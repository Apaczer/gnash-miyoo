The third alpha release of Gnash. Improvements since the 0.7.2 release
are: 

    * Streaming video works with YouTube and Lulu.tv! This has been the
      focus for the majority of the time since the last release.

      being played, but enables more movies to play that used to not work.

      libraries can be exported into ActionScript, and used as native
      commands in a Flash movie.
    * Updated manuals.
    * Many new testcases! Support for testing with ming, swfmill, amd
      mtasc compilers.
