The second alpha release of Gnash is coming soon. Improvements since
the 0.7.1 alpha release are:

* Polling main loop replaced with event driven framework.
* New GUI abstraction layer supporting GTK2, KDE, SDL, and just a
framebuffer. 
* Movies are parsed by a background thread, so they start playing
while still loading.
* Plugin supports web navigation and starts playing while the stream
is loading.
* New AntiGrain (AGG) 2D backend added for framebuffer devices.
* Sound now works.
* Supports cross configuration and cross compiling for embedded targets.
* A whole slew of minor bugs that kept various movies from playing.

GameSWF has been turned into Gnash! Gnash's goals are to turn this
into a free flash movie player plugin for Firefox.
