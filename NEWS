The third alpha release of Gnash. Improvements since the 0.7.2 release
are: 

* Streaming video works with YouTube and Lulu.tv! This has been the
focus for the majority of the time since the last release.
* Many core improvments in the VM as our understanding of Flash
improves. These all improve both the correctness of a movie that is
being played, but enebles more movies to play that used to not work.
* New FLTK2 gui.
* Simple Flash debugger added.
* Improved Darwin support that can use the system OpenGL.
* Flash extensions, direct support for file handling, MySQL access,
etc.. through plugins to the Gnash VM. Wrappers for any C/C++ API
libraries can be exported into ActionScript, and used as native
commands in a Flash movie.
* Updated manuals.
* Many new testcases! Support for testing with ming, swfmill, amd
mtasc compilers.
* New drawing API for MovieClips..

The second alpha release of Gnash is coming soon. Improvements since
the 0.7.1 alpha release are:

* Polling main loop replaced with event driven framework.
* New GUI abstraction layer supporting GTK2, KDE, SDL, and just a
framebuffer. 
* Movies are parsed by a background thread, so they start playing
while still loading.
* Plugin supports web navigation and starts playing while the stream
is loading.
* New AntiGrain (AGG) 2D backend added for framebuffer devices.
* Sound now works.
* Supports cross configuration and cross compiling for embedded targets.
* A whole slew of minor bugs that kept various movies from playing.
