// Implementation for Movie object

/// \page movie SWF Movies
///
/// SWF Movies definitions are created by reading an SWF stream.
/// Gnash doesn't play SWF Movie definitions, but instances.
/// So you can play the same SWF file (Movie definiton) using
/// multiple instances.
///
/// A Movie definition is defined by the gnash::movie_definition class.
/// A Movie instance is defined by the gnash::movie_interface class.
/// 
/// A Movie instance exposes the ActionScript
/// Object base interface (gnash::as_object_interface),
/// thus it can manage gnash::as_value members.
///
/// The implementation of SWF parsing for a Movie definition
/// is found in gnash::movie_def_impl::read.
