/// Holds the immutable data for a sprite/move timeline, as read from
/// as SWF stream.
//
/// Timeline data consists in a set of depths supposed to contain an instance
/// for each frame in the sprite/movie.
///
/// This information is extracted while parsing the SWF so it might be
/// incomplete for a frame until parsing of that frame completes. 
///
/// Multiple threads can use instances of this class.
/// In particular, the loader/parser thread will use the mutators and the movie
/// advancement/actions executors thread will use the inspectors.
/// For this reason access to the data is mutex-protected. Locking info are
/// specified for each locking function.
