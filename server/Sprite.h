/// \page Sprite Sprites and MovieClips
///
/// A Sprite, or MovieClip, is a mini movie-within-a-movie. 
///
/// It doesn't define its own characters;
/// it uses the characters from the parent
/// movie, but it has its own frame counter, display list, etc.
///
/// @@ are we sure it doesn't define its own chars ?
///
/// The sprite implementation is divided into 
/// gnash::sprite_definition and gnash::sprite_instance.
///
/// The _definition holds the immutable data for a sprite (as read
/// from an SWF stream), while the _instance contains the state for
/// a specific run of if (frame being played, mouse state, timers,
/// display list as updated by actions, ...)
///
