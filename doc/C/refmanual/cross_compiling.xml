<title>Cross Compiling</title>

<para>
  To cross configure and compile &app;, begin by building a target system
  on your workstation.  This includes cross compilers for the target
  architecture, and some system headers. 
  You will also need the following packages to be built for the target
  system: <emphasis>libxml2</emphasis>, <emphasis>libpng</emphasis> 
  (if used), <emphasis>libjpeg</emphasis>,oost  <emphasis>b</emphasis>, your
  GUI library, your renderer, and your video handler (if used).  The page
  <ulink url="http://frank.harvard.edu/~coldwell/toolchain/"
	 type="http">http://frank.harvard.edu/~coldwell/toolchain/</ulink>
  has instructions on building a target system from scratch and
  offers a shell script to make the process easier.

<para>
  If you need to build up a target system from scratch, there is
  a good document and shell script at this web site: <ulink
  type="http"
  url="http://frank.harvard.edu/~coldwell/toolchain/">
  http://frank.harvard.edu/~coldwell/toolchain/</ulink>.

<para>
  There is also up to date information on the Gnash Developers
  web site at: <ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnashdev.org">
  http://www.gnashdev.org</ulink>. This is the best place for
  detailed informatin on various systems.

<para>
  After I built up an ARM system in /usr/arm using the shell
  script from this web site, I then cross compiled all the
  other libraries I needed. The fun part is trying to get
  libMesa and boost to cross compile, because they're not really set
  up for it.
</para>

<para>
  So to build for an ARM based system on an x86 based systems,
  configure like this: 
</para>

<programlisting>
  ../../gnash/configure --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu
  --host=arm-linux --prefix=/usr/local/arm/oe --disable-nsapi
  --disable-kparts --enable-gui=fb --enable-renderer=agg --disable-shared
</programlisting>

<para>
  The important configuration options are the ones which specify the
  architecture for the build:
</para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>--target</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The target architecture, where the final executables are expected
        to run.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>--host</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The host architecture, where the executables are expected
        to run.  Usually this is the same as the <emphasis>--target</emphasis>,
        except when building a compiler as a Canadian Cross.  In this
        case, you might build a cross compiler on a UNIX system which
        runs on a win32 machine, producing code for a third architecture,
        such as ARM.  In this example, <emphasis>--target</emphasis> would
        be 'arm-unknown-linux-gnu', while <emphasis>--host</emphasis> would 
        be 'win32'.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>--build</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        This is the system the build is running on.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>
  The following example of <emphasis>configure</emphasis> builds for an
  ARM system on an x86 system.  It was run after an ARM system was built
  in <filename>/usr/arm</filename> and other required libraries were 
  cross compiled.
  <programlisting>
./configure -target=arm-unknown-linux-gnu --prefix=/usr/arm \
--host=arm-unknown-linux-gnu --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --disable-plugin
  </programlisting>
</para>
