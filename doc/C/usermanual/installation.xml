      Before downloading and installing &app;, check that your
      hardware and software meet the following requirements.

      <para>
	One of the goals of &app; is to make it portable enough to install on
	small devices.  As a result, the hardware requirements are
	minimal. &app; has even run on an ARM9 at 200 MHz with 64 MB of RAM!
	(It ran without video support in this case.)   While firm minimums
	have not been established, &app; has been shown to run successfully
	with the following:

      <para>
	The &appversion; release of &app; has been designed to run on
	UNIX/Linux variants, and has been run on most of the free ones.
	However, &app; has successfully run on Windows, Darwin (Mac OS X),
	Irix, Solaris, BeOs, OS/2, and Haiku.  &app; has also run on the
	following 64-bit systems: PowerPC, Itanium, UltraSparc, and AMD64.
	For now, it is important to be sure that the following code, testing,
	and documentation dependencies are met before installing &app;.  If
	you will be downloading &app; with a package manager, these
	dependencies may be solved by the package manager.  Otherwise, you
	must first verify that each of these dependencies are installed on the
	target system.

      <para>
	There are two ways to download &app;: using a package manager or by
	downloading the source code and building it on your system. If
	possible, it is advisable to use a package manager to download &app;,
	as it will resolve dependencies for you.  However, if you want the
	very latest features, or a &app; package is not available for your
	operating system, it is better to download the source code and build
	&app; locally.

	<title>Getting the Source</title>
	
	<para>
	  &app; is available as a <link linkend="sourcereleases">release
	  tarball</link>, a <link linkend="sourcerepo">development 
	  checkout</link>, or a <link linkend="sourcesnapshot">development

	<sect3 id="sourcereleases">
	  <title>Releases</title>
	  
	  <para>
	    The source can be acquired from a
	    <ulink type="http" 
		   url="http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html">GNU FTP
	    Mirror</ulink>.  The release version is intended to be
	    stable, and is probably your best choice if the release took
	    place recently.  If you need features or fixes which were
	    introduced after the release, consider a 
	    <link linkend="sourcerepo">CVS checkout</link> or the
	    <link linkend="sourcesnapshot">daily snapshot</link>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    To download, select a mirror near you, then choose the
	    <filename>gnash</filename> directory.

	<sect3 id="sourcerepo">
	  <title>Repository</title>
	  
	  <para>
	    The latest development sources are available via
	    anonymous CVS.  This is recommended
	    if you need features or bug fixes which were introduced after
	    the <link linkend="sourcereleases">last release</link>.  Look at
	    the <link linkend="sourcesnapshot">daily snapshot</link> if you
	    experience difficulty accessing the repository.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    To download via anonymous CVS, first set the
	    environment variable <command>CVS_RSH</command> to
	    <command>ssh</command>, then check out the source code.
	    The example below uses the GNU Bourne-Again shell (bash): 
	  </para>
	  
	  <screen>
	    export CVS_RSH="ssh"
	    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gnash co gnash
	  </screen>
	  
	  <para>
	    It is also possible to browse the repository
	    <ulink url="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/gnash/?root=gnash"
		   type="http" /> on the web.
	  </para>
	</sect3>
	
	<sect3 id="sourcesnapshot">
	  <title>Snapshot</title>
	  
	  <para>
	    The daily development snapshot can be downloaded from
	    <ulink url="http://www.gnashdev.org/dev_snapshots/"
		   type="http">http://www.gnashdev.org/dev_snapshots/</ulink>.
	    This is the best option if you need changes which were introduced
	    after the <link linkend="sourcereleases">last release</link> of
	    &app;, but are unable to <link linkend="sourcerepo">download
	    directly from the repository.</link>
