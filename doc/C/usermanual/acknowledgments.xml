      The first version of this guide was written by Rob Savoye.  If not for
      his tireless efforts, this book - and this project - would never have
      come this far.

      John Steinhart has also been supportive of the project from the
      beginning. I have shamelessly plagiarized one of his early
      announcement emails in the early part of this chapter.

      Ann Barcomb was instrumental in taking this guide from the 0.3.0 to
      the 0.4.0 version, incorporating the many changes that came with &app;
      version 0.8.0.

    <para>
      &app; is based on the public domain program
      <application>GameSWF</application>, which is a graphics library
      for games that contains the heart of a SWF interpreter.  In December
      2005, &app; was forked from <application>GameSWF</application> and
      repackaged in the GNU project style, and a major recoding started.
    </para>

      Finally, thanks to all of the &app; developers I haven't mentioned for
      all their hard work, and for answering my unending questions.
