        In this document, the term 'ActionScript class' refers to the
        C++ class which is instantiated by Gnash when some ActionScript
        code instantiates a corresponding class.  The C++ class
        stores instance data and implements the methods which are 
        called on the object in the ActionScript code.

          <para>
            When Gnash starts, the <emphasis>class_init()</emphasis> method 
            for each ActionScript class (listed in Global.cpp) is called.
            This method constructs a prototype, which is implemented as an
            <emphasis>as_object</emphasis>.  In addition, the method
            registers the constructor to be used for future object creation,
            and attaches methods and properties to the prototype.

            When a new object is needed, instance data is added to
            the methods and properties inherited from the prototype.
