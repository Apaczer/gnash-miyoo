        <title>&app; Overview</title>

        <para>
          &app; started life as <application>GameSWF</application>,
          a free Flash movie player with fairly good Flash format v7
          compliance.  In December 2005, &app; was forked from
          <application>GameSWF</application> and repackaged in the
          GNU project style.  The objective of &app; is to create an
          industrial strength Flash movie player which can be widely
          deployed.

        <para>
          &app; can be used as a stand-alone player, as a Mozilla
          Firefox plugin, or as a Konqueror plugin ('Kpart').  
          The plugin works by creating a new window in the stand-alone
          player which is connected to the browser window.

         <title>Flash Support</title>

         <para>
           &app; supports the majority of Flash opcodes up to SWF version
           7, and a wide sampling of ActionScript classes for SWF version
           7.   There are plans to work towards greater support for SWF
           8 and beyond.  AMF support is minimal.
