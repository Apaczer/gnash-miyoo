 <para>
      &app; is a free Flash movie player.  It is available as a stand-alone application or as a plugin for several popular browsers.
</para>

<para>
&app; is based on the excellent work done on the public domain program <application>GameSWF</application>, which is a graphics library for games that contains the heart of a Flash interpreter.  In December 2005, &app; was forked from <application>GameSWF</application> and repackaged in the GNU project style.  The objective of &app; is to create an enterprise-quality Flash movie player that can be widely deployed.

<title>What does &app; run on?</title>

<para>
The list of successful &app; deployments grows every day.  At this time, &app; has been found to run on several different UNIX and Linux distributions.  The plugin currently works with any browser that uses the NSAPI. This includes:

         <title>What Versions of Flash are Supported?</title>

         <para>
           &app; supports the majority of Flash opcodes up to SWF version
           7, and a wide sampling of ActionScript classes for SWF version
           7.   There are plans to work towards greater support for SWF
           8 and beyond.  AMF support is minimal.

<title>Audience</title>

<para>
This manual is primarily focused on developers interested in contributing to or building from the &app; project.  It serves as a detailed reference guide, including a catalog and explanation of all options and features.  This level of detail may make this guide cumbersome for the average user, although advanced users may find it helpful.
</para>

<para>
Those who are new to &app; will find the <citetitle>&app; User's Guide</citetitle>, currently under development, to be more useful when learning to use &app;.

<title>Guide Conventions</title>

<para>
This guide makes use of the following fairly standard typefaces, highlighting, and language usage:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><application>application</application></term>
<listitem>
<para>
The typeface above will be used whenever an application, such as <application>Firefox</application> or <application>OpenOffice.org</application>, is mentioned.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><command>command</command></term>
<listitem>
<para>
The typeface above will be used whenever the text instructs a user to enter a command at a shell prompt in UNIX/Linux, such as <command>ls</command>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><computeroutput>computeroutput</computeroutput></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This is the typeface used to indicate information produced on <computeroutput>stdout</computeroutput> by the computer.  This include error messages and prompts.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><filename>filename</filename></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This typeface indicates that the text is the name (and possibly the path) of a specific file on the system in question.  For example, <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> would appear in this typeface.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guibutton>guibutton</guibutton></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This formatting indicates a button on a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  If this formatting appears, look for a button with the same text on the GUI of the &app; player; the button itself may look slightly different.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guimenu>guimenu</guimenu></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This typeface indicates the topmost menu item in a GUI.  For example, in many applications the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu item is a top=level menu item.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guimenuitem>guimenuitem</guimenuitem></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This typeface indicates a sub-menu item in a GUI.  For example, in many applications the <guimenuitem>Save As</guimenuitem> menu item is a sub-menu item.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><guilabel>guitext</guilabel></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This typeface indicates a text string on the GUI.  This is generally a text string that appears on the GUI that is not a button or menuitem.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><keycap>key</keycap></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This typeface indicates a specific key on the keyboard.  For example, the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key appears in this typeface.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><keycombo><keycap>key</keycap><keycap>combination</keycap></keycombo></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This formatting indicates a set of keys to be pressed at the same time.  A familiar key combination is <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>Delete</keycap></keycombo>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><replaceable>&lt;replaceable&gt;</replaceable></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Whenever a general term is included in an example as a placeholder, it will be signaled by this formatting.  This formatting will usually appear inside other formatting.  For example, <filename>/home/<replaceable>&lt;username&gt;</replaceable></filename> indicates the home directory of a user, whose actual username would be substituted in for <replaceable>&lt;username&gt;</replaceable>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><userinput>User input</userinput></term>
<listitem>
<para>
This typeface indicates anything that the user must enter, whether that is at a shell prompt or in response to a GUI prompt. 
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<title>Acknowledgments</title>

<para>
The first version of this guide was written by Rob Savoye.  If not for his tireless efforts, this book - and this project - would never have come this far.
</para>

<para>
John Steinhart has also been dedicated to the project from the beginning. I have shamelessly plagiarized one of his early announcement emails in the early part of this chapter.
</para>

<para>
Ann Barcomb was instrumental in taking this guide from the 0.3.0 to the 0.4.0 version, incorporating the many changes that came with &app; version 0.8.0.
</para>

<para>
Finally, thanks to all of the &app; developers I haven't mentioned for all their hard work, and for answering my unending questions.
