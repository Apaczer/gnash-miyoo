  <title>Mozilla/Firefox Plugin</title>

  <para>
    The Mozilla SDK has two layers. The older layer is documented in
    the <ulink type="http"
    url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/manual/plugin.pdf">
    Geeko Plugin API Reference</ulink>, and the newer layer doesn't
    appear to be documented. The new API is simpler, and is portable
    across multiple versions of Mozilla or Firefox. The new API is
    just a layer on top of the older one, so this manual still
    applies.
  </para>

  <para>
    Most of the programming of a plugin is filling in real code for
    the standard API functions and methods. Firefox uses these to
    create the plugin, and to send it data.
  </para>

  <para>
    When initializing or destroying a plugin, no matter how many
    instances are being used, the C API is used. These functions are
    typically called once for each plugin that is loaded.
  </para>
    
  <sect5 id="plugincapi">
    <title>Plugin C API</title>

    <para>
      The lower layer is a C based API that is used by Firefox to
      initialize and destroy a plugin. This is so a plugin can be
      portable across multiple systems, since C++ code is not portable
      between most C++ compilers. This where most of the behind the
      scenss work is done in a plugin. For Gnash, the sources this
      lower layer are in <code>plugin/mozilla-sdk</code>. They were
      added to the Gnash source tree so it wouldn't be necessary to
      have the Mozilla development packages installed to compile the
      Gnash plugin.
    </para>

    <para>
      This is also the older API used for plugins, so is usually the
      one used if you dig around for plugin examples on the web. These
      are the main functions that have to be implemented in a plugin
      for it to be recognized by the browser, and to be initialized
      and destroyed.

	    This C function gets called once when the plugin is

  <sect5 id="plugincppapi">
    <title>Plugin C++ API</title>

    <para>
      The higher level layer is the one we are most concerned
      with. This is an instantiation of the
      <code>nsPluginInstanceBase</code> class, as defined by the
      Mozilla SDK, for our plugin. With this API, a plugin is mostly
      defining the standard entry points for Firefox, and the code
      that implements the glue between the Firefox and our plugin.
    </para>

    <para>
      These are called for each instantiation of plugin. If there are
      three Flash movies on a web page, then three instances are
      created. Unfortunately for plugin programmers, these functions
      may randomly be called more than once, so it's good to use
      initialization flags for things that ahould only be done one per
      thread. For instance, <code>nsPluginInstance::init()</code> and
      <code>nsPluginInstance::SetWindow()</code> are called more than
      once, so the plugin must protect against actions that could be
      destructive.
    </para>

	    the plugin to setup the window. This may get called
	    multiple times by each instantiated object, so it can't
	    do much but window specific setup here. This is where the
	    main code is that sets up the window for the plugin.

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Opens a new incoming data stream, which is the flash
	    movie we want to play. A URL can be pretty ugly, like in
	    this example:
	    http://www.sckwave.com/swf/navbar/navbar_sw.swf?atfilms=http%3a//www.atomfilms.com/af/home/&amp;shockwave=http%3a//www.shkwave.com&amp;gameblast=http%3a//gamebst.sckwave.com/gb/gbHome.jsp&amp;known=0 ../flash/gui.swf?ip_addr=foobar.com&amp;ip_port=3660&amp;show_cursor=true&amp;path_prefix=../flash/&amp;trapallkeys=true"
	    So this is where we parse the URL to get all the options
	    passed in when invoking the plugin.

    <title>OpenGL and Threads</title>
    <para>
      Neither OpenGL nor X11 has any built-in support for threads. Most
      actions aren't even atomic, so care has to be made to not corrupt
      any internal data. While it is difficult to render OpenGL from
      multiple threads, it can be done with the proper locking. The
      downside is the locking adds a performance hit, since all the
      threads will have to have the access sychronized by using
      mutexes.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The X11 context is maintained one per instantiation of the
      plugin. It is necessary to lock access to the X11 context when
      using threads by using <code>XLockDisplay()</code> and
      <code>XUnlockDisplay()</code>. A connection to the X11
      server is opened for every instantiation of the plugin using
      <code>XOpenDisplay()</code>.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The <code>The GLX Context</code> is maintained one per
      instantiation of the plugin for a web page. If there are more
      than one Flash movie, there is more than one GLX Context. A GLX
      context can be created by using <code>glXCreateContext()</code>,
      and then later destroyed by using <code>glXDestroyContext()</code>.
      When swapping threads, the context is changed using
      <code>glXMakeCurrent()</code>.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      All the code that directly accesses a GLX context or the X11
      display must be wrapped with a mutex.

  <sect5 id="eventhandle">
    <title>Plugin Event Handling</title>
    <para>
      Firefox on most unix systems is a GTK+ application, so it is
      possible to have the plugin hook into the X11 event handling via
      GLX. It would be possible to use gtk event callbacks, if I could
      ever figure out how to get a GTK Widget from an X11 window ID.
    </para>

    <para>
      Rather than directly hook into the X11 event system, Gnash uses
      SDL from within the player main loop itself to process
      events. Optional Gnash can use a separete thread to process user
      events by pushing them into the SDL event queue quicker.
