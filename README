  Gnash is originally based on the code of GameSWF, by Thatcher
Ulrich. GameSWF is the most advanced of the free flash movie player
projects, and implements a fairly broad set of Flash Format v7
compliance. GameSWF was unsupported public domain software though,
and not really setup to be an industrial strength projecrt that could
be used by everyone that uses Firefox.

  So in early December of 2005, GameSWF was forked, and the code
rearranged in GNU project style.
