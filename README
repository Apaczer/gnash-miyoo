  Gnash is originally based on the code of GameSWF, by Thatcher
Ulrich. GameSWF is the most advanced of the free flash movie player
projects, and implements a fairly broad set of Flash Format v7
compliance. GameSWF was unsupported public domain software though,
and not really setup to be an industrial strength project that could
be used by everyone that uses Firefox.

  So in early December of 2005, GameSWF was forked, and the code
rearranged in GNU project style.

Building Gnash:
---------------

To build Gnash, you currently need the Mozilla or Firefox development
packages installed. I have added the basic Mozilla SDK files, so at
least you don't need the full Mozilla/Firefox sources. You can tell if
you have these packages installed, because either a firefox-config or
mozilla-config should be present. If neither of these aren't present,
the plugin won't be part of the build. 

If these are present, then when you install the plugin, it gets
installed in the plugin directory of the same firefox that's in your
path. 

You can also specify explicit paths to the Mozilla SDK by using the
--with-firefox, --with-firefox-libraries, or --with-firefox-headers
options at configure time. You'll also want the OpenGL development
package and the SDL development packages installed as well. 

Currently the plugin renders a hard coded OpenGL graphic in the
allocated window within the browers. You'll have better luck with the
standalone version, gnash. Development of the plugin is continuing,
however, now that much of the basic creation of this new project is
done. 

I'm using the Mozilla plugin API, so although the functionality of the
plugin is limited at this time, it has worked in a variety of
different versions of Mozilla and Firefox.

Gnash has three mailing lists hosted at gnu.org. Archives of these
lists are stored at http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/: 

    * gnash@gnu.org is for discussion of Gnash. Ideas for the future,
      general gnash usage or problems, etc... New alpha and stable
      releases are announced here. To subscribe, go the
      http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnash. Volume is typically
      low.
    * gnash-dev@gnu.org is for discussion of gnash development,
      porting to new platforms, ideas for the future. This is where
      the nitty-gritty gets discussed about Gnash, and is the best
      list for technical questions. To subscribe, go the
      http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnash-dev 
    * gnash-commit@gnu.org is where summaries of changes commited to
      the CVS repository are automatically posted. If you wish to see
      these changes as they happen,
      http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnash-commit Volume is
      sporadic, but typically low.

If you would like any new feature to be included in future versions of
Gnash, please send a request to <gnash-dev@gnu.org>. You can also
submit patches at https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?group=gnash.

Please remember that development of Gnash is a volunteer effort, and
you can also contribute to its development. For information about
