Using Gnash CVS repository.

Building gnash from CVS requires the following additional packages:

	- automake (version?)
	- autoheader (version?)
	- aclocal (version?)
	- autoconf (version?)
	- intltool (version?)
	- xml-i18n-toolize (version?)
	- libtool (version?)
	- glib-gettextize (version?)
	- libltdl (version?)

All the above tools are used by the ./autogen.sh script, which you'd run
to setup the build scripts as they are distributed.
If anything is missing, autogen.sh should tell you.

Once ./autogen.sh completes successfully you can go on with normal
instructions found in the README file.
