    <span class="application">Gnash</span> is a free SWF movie player.  It is available as a
    stand-alone application or as a plugin for several popular
    web browsers. It supports playing media from a disk or streaming
    over a network connection. Some popular video sharing sites like
    YouTube are supported from a wide vaariety of devices from
    embedded ones to modern desktops.
  </p><p>
    <span class="application">Gnash</span> has a better focus on security, allowing the user tight
    control of all network or disk based I/O. Gnash also supports
    extending ActionScript by creating your own. You can write
    wrappers for any development library, and import them into the
    player much like perl or python does.
  </p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="audience"></a>Audience</h2></div></div></div><p>
      This manual is primarily focused on users interested in how to
      get Gnash installed from a package, and basic usage as a web
      browser plugin. For more technical details, please refer to the
      Gnash Reference manual.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="runs-on"></a>What Is Supported ?</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Gnash is known to compile for most any POSIX and ANSI C++
      conforming system if you have all the dependent libraries
      installed. Systems we test on, and which Gnash is know to
      run on are Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
      Win32, and Darwin (OSX) primarily. Occasionally other platforms
      are built, primarily by those distribution maintainers. This
      includes BeOS, Haiku, Syllable, OS/2, Solaris, Slackware, and
      Gentoo.
    </p><p>
      Gnash is a capable of reading up to SWF v9 files and opcodes,
      but primarily supports SWF v7, with better SWF v8 and v9
      support under heavy developement. With the 0.8.2 release,
      Gnash includes initial parser support for SWF v8 and v9.
      Not all ActionScript 2 classes are implemented yet, but all of the
      most heavily used ones are. Many ActionScript 2 classes are
      partially implemented; there is support for all of the
      commonly used methods of each class.
    </p><p>
      Gnash has implemented about 80% of ActionScript v. 2.0, and has
      begun implementing ActionScript v. 3.0. Gnash supports the
      majority of Flash opcodes up to SWF version 9, and a wide
      sampling of ActionScript classes for SWF version 8.
    </p><p>
      As ActionsScript 3 is a more developed version of
      ActionScript 2, many of the same classes work for
      both. Support has been added to Gnash's ActionScript library
      to support the new ActionScript 3 filters, which get applied
      to every class. Implementing ActionScript clases is often the
      easiest way for new Gnash developers to make a contribution
      without a deep internal knpowledge of Gnash.
    </p><p>
      Gnash has included video support since early 2007, but this is
      an every changing field of reverse engineering. Many of the
      popular video sharing sites use SWF v8 or v9, which Gnash
      still has imperfect support for. This is improving all the
      time, so often builds from a development snapshot will work
      when using the older release packaged in your distribution
      doesn't. You can find daily snapshots of the latest CVS tree
      at: <a href="http://www.gnashdev.org/dev_snapshots/" target="_top">
      http://www.gnashdev.org/dev_snapshots</a>.
    </p><p>
      Gnash uses ffmpeg for codecs, so any file supported by Mplayer
      should work with Gnash. Gnash supports the loading of patent
      free codecs like Ogg Vorbis or Theora from disk based files,
      while work is being done to support these codecs when embedded
      in a SWF file. Ffmpeg contains the codecs used by the current
      SWF defintion, FLV, VP6 (ON2), H.263, H.264, and MP3.

    This document is based mostly on my own reverse engineering of the
    RTMP protocol and AMF format. <span class="emphasis"><em>tcpdump</em></span> and
    <span class="emphasis"><em>ethereal</em></span> are your friend. Some additional info that got
    me started was from the <a href="http://www.osflash.org/red5" target="_top">Red5</a>
    project. <span class="emphasis"><em>Red5</em></span> is the only other open source Flash
    server. So some details are still vague, but as the implementation
    appears to work, we'll figure out what they are later.
  </p><p>
    The Real Time Messaging Protocol was created by MacroMedia (now
    Adobe) for delivering Flash objects and video over a network
    connection. Currently the only servers which support this format
    are the MacroMedia Media sever, and the Open Source Red5 project.
  </p><p>
    This is a simple protocol, optimized for poor bandwidth
    connections. It can support up to 64 concurrent streams over the
    same network connection. Part of each AMF packet header contains
    the index number of the stream. A single RTMP message can contain
    multiple AMF packets.
  </p><p>
    An RTMP connection uses Tcp/ip port 1935. It is also possible to
    tunnel RTMP over an HTTP connection using port 80. Each AMF packet
    is 128 bytes long except for streaming audio, which has 64 byte
    packets.
  </p><p>
    The basics of the RTMP protocol are as follows. All communications
    are initiated by the client.
    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/rtmp.png" align="middle"></div><p>
  </p><p>
    The client starts the RTMP connection by sending a single byte
    with a value of 0x3. This byte is followed by a data block of 1536
    bytes. The format if this data block is unknown, but it appears to
    not be actually used by the protocol except as a handshake.
  </p><p>
    The server receives this packet, stores the 1536 byte data block,
    and then send a single byte with the value of 0x3, followed by two
    1536 data blocks. The second data block is the full contents of
    the original data block as sent by the client.
  </p><p>
    The client receives the 1536 byte data block, and if they match,
    the connection is established. After the handshake process is
    done, there are three other messages that the client sends to the
    sever to start the data flowing.
  </p><p>
    The first AMF packet sent to the server contains the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>connect</em></span> packet. This doesn't appear to do
    much but notify the server the client is happy with the
    handshake, and ready to start reading packets.
  </p><p>
    The second packet is the <span class="emphasis"><em>NetConnection</em></span> object from
    the client. This ActionScript class is used by the Flash movie to
    create the network connection to the server.
  </p><p>
    The third packet is the <span class="emphasis"><em>NetStream</em></span> object from the
    client. This is the ActionScript class used to specify the file to
    be streamed by the server.
  </p><p>
    The RTMP packet for our example looks like this:
   
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      030000190000c91400000000020007connect00?f0000000000000030003app0200#
      software/gnash/tests/1153948634.flv0008flashVer02000cLNX 6,0,82,0 0006
      swfUrl02001dfile:///file|%2Ftmp%2Fout.swfc30005tcUrl\002\0004
      rtmp://localhost/software/gnash/tests/1153948634.flv\000\000\t
      \002\000\005userx
    </pre><p>
    
    We'll take this apart in a bit, but you can see how all three AMF
    packets are in the same message. The message is received in
    several 128 byte blocks, with the last one being less than
    that. The total size of the RTMP message is in the header, so the
    reader can tell if the entire message was read or not.
  </p><p>
    The RTMP header is first, followed by the connect message as an
    ASCII string as the message body. The following AMF packet is the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>NetConnection</em></span> one, which specifies that this is coming
    from a Flash application. This also contains the file path the server
    can use to find the file to stream. This is then followed by the
    version number, which I assume is the version of the Flash player,
    so the server knows what it is talking to.
  </p><p>
    The third packet is the one from <span class="emphasis"><em>NetStream</em></span>, which
    specifies the URL used for the movie, followed by the user name
    for a semblance of security.
  </p><p>
    For the next level of detail, we'll explain the format of AMF. AMF
    is used by the RTMP protocol to transfer data. Each Flash object
    is encapsulated in an AMF packet, including streaming audio or
    video.
  </p><p>
    The first byte of the RTMP header determines two things about the
    rest of the message. The first 2 bits of this byte signify the
    total size of the RTMP header. The RTMP header is of a variable
    size, so this is important.

    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">00</span></dt><dd><p>
 	    This specifies the header contains 12 bytes, including
	    this one.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">01</span></dt><dd><p>
 	    This specifies the header contains 8 bytes, including this
	    one.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">02</span></dt><dd><p>
 	    This specifies the header contains 4 bytes, including this
	    one.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">03</span></dt><dd><p>
 	    This specifies the header contains 1 byte, so this is the
	    complete header.
	  </p></dd></dl></div><p>
  </p><p>
    The other 6 bits in this byte represent the AMF index. As a single
    RTMP connection can support multiple data streams, this signifies
    which stream this packet is for. Once an AMF object is fully
    received by the client, the AMF index may be reused.
  </p><p>
    For messages with headers of at least 4 bytes, the next 3 bytes are
    used by audio and video data packets, but at this time the meaning
    of this field is unknown.
  </p><p>
    For messages with a 8 byte or larger header, the next 3 bytes
    determine the size of the RTMP message being transmitted. Messages
    with a 1 byte or 4 byte header use a standard size, 128 bytes for
    video, and 64 bytes for audio.
  </p><p>
    For messages with an 8 byte or larger header, the next byte is the
    type of the AMF object.

    There are two sets of data types to consider. One set is used by
    the to specify the content type of the AMF object, the other is an
    ActionScript data type tag used to denote which type of object is
    being transferred.
  </p><p>

  </p><p>
    For messages with a 12 byte header, the last 4 bytes are the
    routing of the message. If the destination is the server, this
    value is the NetStream object source. If the destination is the
    client, this is the NetStream object for this RTMP message. A
    value of 0x00000000 appears to be reserved for the NetConnection
    object. 
  </p><p>
    Multiple AMF streams can be contained in a single RTMP messages,
    so it's important to check the index of each AMF packet.
  </p><p>
    An example RTMP header might look like this. (spaces added between
    fields for clarity) All the numbers are in hex.

    </p><pre class="screen">

    The AMF format is used in the LocalConnection, SharedObject,
    NetConnection, and NetStream ActionScript classes. This is a means
    of binary data interchange between Flash movies, or between a
    Flash player and a Flash server.
  </p><p>
    Like the RTMP messages, an AMF packet header can be of a variable
    size. The size is either the same as the initial header of the
    RTMP message, or a 1 byte header, which is commonly used for
    streaming audio or video data.
  </p><p>
    The body of an AMF packet may look something like this

PREAMBLE</h2></div></div></div><p>
      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other written document "free" in the sense of
      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
      commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this License
      preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
      their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.
    </p><p>
      This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means
      that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
      the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
      which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
    </p><p>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
      free program should come with manuals providing the same
      freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited
      to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
      regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
      printed book. We recommend this License principally for works
      whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="fdl-section1"></a>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</h2></div></div></div><p><a name="fdl-document"></a>
      This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
      notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. The
      "Document", below, refers to any such manual or
      work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
      as "you".
    </p><p><a name="fdl-modified"></a>
      A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
      containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
      verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
      language.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-secondary"></a>
      A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a
      front-matter section of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> that deals exclusively
      with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
      Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
      matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within
      that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
      textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
      legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
      regarding them.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-invariant"></a>
      The "Invariant Sections" are certain <a href="#fdl-secondary"> Secondary Sections</a> whose titles
      are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
      notice that says that the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> is released under this
      License.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-cover-texts"></a>
      The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of
      text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts,
      in the notice that says that the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> is released under this
      License.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-transparent"></a>
      A "Transparent" copy of the <a href="#fdl-document"> Document</a> means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
      to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited
      directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
      images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
      drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
      translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
      whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy
      that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    </p><p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
      plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
      format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
      standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
      modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
      proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
      and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
      machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for
      output purposes only.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-title-page"></a>
      The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
      title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
      hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in
      the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title
      page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
      most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="fdl-section2"></a>2. VERBATIM COPYING</h2></div></div></div><p>
      You may copy and distribute the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
      applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
      you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
      License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
      control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
      distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
      copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
      must also follow the conditions in <a href="#fdl-section3" title="3. COPYING IN QUANTITY">section 3</a>.
    </p><p>
      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
      above, and you may publicly display copies.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="fdl-section3"></a>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h2></div></div></div><p>
      If you publish printed copies of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> numbering more than 100,
      and the Document's license notice requires <a href="#fdl-cover-texts">Cover Texts</a>, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
      Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
      Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
      copies. The front cover must present the full title with all
      words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
      limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
      <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> and satisfy these
      conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.
    </p><p>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
      adjacent pages.
    </p><p>
      If you publish or distribute <a href="#fdl-transparent">Opaque</a> copies of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> numbering more than 100,
      you must either include a machine-readable <a href="#fdl-transparent">Transparent</a> copy along with
      each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
      material, which the general network-using public has access to
      download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
      protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take
      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
      copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
      or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
      public.
    </p><p>
      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
      of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> well before
      redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance
      to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

      You may copy and distribute a <a href="#fdl-modified">Modified Version</a> of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> under the conditions of
      sections <a href="#fdl-section2" title="2. VERBATIM COPYING">2</a> and <a href="#fdl-section3" title="3. COPYING IN QUANTITY">3</a> above, provided that you release
      the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
      Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
      licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version
      to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
      these things in the Modified Version:

      If the <a href="#fdl-modified">Modified Version</a>
      includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as
      <a href="#fdl-secondary">Secondary Sections</a> and
      contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your
      option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To
      do this, add their titles to the list of <a href="#fdl-invariant">Invariant Sections</a> in the
      Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be
      distinct from any other section titles.
    </p><p>
      You may add a section entitled "Endorsements",
      provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your <a href="#fdl-modified">Modified Version</a> by various

      Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text
      may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one

      publisher that added the old one.
    </p><p>
      The author(s) and publisher(s) of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> do not by this License

      terms defined in <a href="#fdl-section4" title="4. MODIFICATIONS">section 4</a>
      above for modified versions, provided that you include in the
      combination all of the <a href="#fdl-invariant">Invariant
      Sections</a> of all of the original documents, unmodified,
      and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in
      its license notice.
    </p><p>
      The combined work need only contain one copy of this License,
      and multiple identical <a href="#fdl-invariant">Invariant
      Sections</a> may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
      multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
      contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
      at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
      author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
      number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the
      list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined
      work.
    </p><p>
      In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
      "History" in the various original documents,
      forming one section entitled "History"; likewise
      combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
      and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must
      delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

      released under this License, and replace the individual copies
      of this License in the various documents with a single copy that
      is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
      rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
      documents in all other respects.
    </p><p>
      You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
      distribute it individually under this License, provided you
      insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
      follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
      copying of that document.

      A compilation of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> or its derivatives with
      other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a
      volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole
      count as a <a href="#fdl-modified">Modified Version</a>
      of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed
      for the compilation.  Such a compilation is called an
      "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
      other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document , on
      account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.  If the <a href="#fdl-cover-texts">Cover Text</a> requirement of <a href="#fdl-section3" title="3. COPYING IN QUANTITY">section 3</a> is applicable to these
      copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
      quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may
      be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
      aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
      aggregate.

      Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
      distribute translations of the <a href="#fdl-document">Document</a> under the terms of <a href="#fdl-section4" title="4. MODIFICATIONS">section 4</a>. Replacing <a href="#fdl-invariant"> Invariant Sections</a> with
      translations requires special permission from their copyright
      holders, but you may include translations of some or all
      Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
      Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this
      License provided that you also include the original English
      version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the
      translation and the original English version of this License,
      the original English version will prevail.
