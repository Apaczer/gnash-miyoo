Description: free SWF movie player
 Gnash is a free Flash movie player, which works either standalone, or as
 plugin for Firefox/Mozilla or Konqueror. Currently it is in a alpha state.
 The plugins are under heavy development at this time.
 .
 Gnash supports the majority of Flash opcodes up to SWF version 7, and
 a wide sampling of ActionScript classes for SWF version 8.5. All the
 core ones are implemented, and many of the newer ones work, but may be
 missing some of their methods.
 .
 Included in the Gnash is an XML based messaging system, as specified in
 the Flash specification. This lets a flash movie communicate over a TCP/IP
 socket, and parse the incoming XML message. This lets a movie be a remote
 control for other devices or applications.
 .
 This package includes the standalone GTK+-based OpenGL player.
