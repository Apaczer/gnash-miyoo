The dump-gnash utility records audio and video coming out
from playing an SWF into a raw data for video and WAV file
for audio.

Switches supported in addition to the one reported by 
gnash --help are:

 -S <ms>
   Sleep for the given amount of milliseconds for each heart-beat.
   By default there's no sleep.
   You may want to add some sleeping IFF the SWF file you are willing
   to record doesn't contain proper loading code (ie: _assumes_ loads
   will happen within a given number of frames advancements).

 -D <filename>
   Name of a file to dump video frames to.
