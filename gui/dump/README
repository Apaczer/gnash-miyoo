The dump-gnash utility records audio and video coming out
from playing an SWF into a raw data for video and WAV file
for audio.

Switches supported in addition to the one reported by 
gnash --help are:

 -S <ms>
   Sleep for the given amount of milliseconds for each heart-beat.
   By default there's no sleep.
   You may want to add some sleeping IFF the SWF file you are willing
   to record doesn't contain proper loading code (ie: _assumes_ loads
   will happen within a given number of frames advancements).

 -D <filename>
   Name of a file to dump video frames to.
   By default the frequency of video frames dump is driven by
   the heart-beat (defaults to 10ms per beat [100FPS],
   you can change using the -d switch).
   You can override video output FPS by appending a @<value> to
   the filename. This will be independent to heart-beating, which
   would be always best to be a submultiple of SWF and video output
   FPSs. Example:

    dump-gui -D out.raw@12 input.swf
