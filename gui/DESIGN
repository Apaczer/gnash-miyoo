Overview
========

GUI is the window creation, borders, events, etc.
Renderer is what we use to draw graphics onto the drawing area

GUI
===

Frontends are modeled by the gnash::Gui class.

They take care of initializing the Backend module for use in rendering.

For the frontend we have GTK, SDL, KDE(QT), FLTK2, Aqua, Framebuffer.


Renderer
========

Backends modeled by the gnash::render_handler class.

They are the actual renderers, drawing to a memory buffer.

For the renderers we have Antigrain (AGG), OpenGL or Cairo.
