Plays two small sounds played in sequence.
Each sound is accompained with a label showing in sync with it's start.

They are either uncompressed or in ADPCM, which the
gstreamer-backend doesn't suport yet

sdl sound handler plays this fine (doesn't need --enable-mp3)

gst sound handler is currently unable to play this, but it's being worked on.
