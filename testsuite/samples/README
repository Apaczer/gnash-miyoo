== Origin == 

== Description ==

Plays two small sounds played in sequence.
Each sound is accompained with a label showing in sync with it's start.

They are either uncompressed or in ADPCM, which the
gstreamer-backend doesn't suport yet

sdl sound handler plays this fine (doesn't need --enable-mp3)

gst sound handler is currently unable to play this, but it's being worked on.

== Origin == 

== Description ==

Displais two circles on top and two circles inscribed into two rectangles
on the bottom. A textfield centered on the bottom is used to print
events.

The circle on top-left is yellow and reacts to mouse button press by
changing color to gray and printing "movie clip pressed" in the textfield.
(it's a movieclip, most likely)

The circle on top-right is blue and reacts to mouse button press by
changing color to green and printing "button pressed" in the textfield.
(it's a button, most likely)

The rectangle on bottom-left is light blue and reacts to mouse button press by
printing "big movie clip pressed" in the textfield. The circle inscribed
in it is yellow but doesn't handle mouse events itself, so clicking on
it does the same thing as clicking in the rectangle that contains it.

The rectangle on bottom-right is light blue and doesn't react to mouse button
press. The circle incribed in it is yellow and react to mouse button press
by changing color to a kind of dark cyan and printing
"small movie clip pressed" in the textfield.

Produced by Udo Giacomozzi, gnash developer.

== Description ==

This is a test for shapes and the new_shape flag. Flash always tries
to combine multiple layers to one single shape if possible (when the
keyframes match and no dynamic objects are contained). To ensure the
correct Z-order while drawing it inserts a flag in the stream that
marks the switch to a higher layer. In Gnash, this flag is found in
the "path" class named "m_new_shape". The first path always has this
flag set.

The test contains three layers: Two rectangular shapes and a middle
layer with a red line. The line must be covered by the blue rectangle
but not by the gray rectangle.
