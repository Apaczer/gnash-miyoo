This directory is contain scripts to run swfdec trace-based testsuite.

The PASSING file is a list of SWF files in the testsuite which is expected to pass,
when new tests are added they'll be expected to fail by default.
If you see an unexpected success you can add the name of the file to PASSING.

You'll need to pass the --with-swfdec-testsuite switch to configure in order
for swfdec tests to be run as part of the 'make check' rule.

Have fun.
