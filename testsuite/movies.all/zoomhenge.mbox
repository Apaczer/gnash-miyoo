Hi Greg,

I'd be honored. If it is being distributed at a profit , I would  
expect a minimal royalty, albeit miniscule. But since it is an Open  
Source project, I assume no profit motive at this time. That said,  
Hell yeah! Include it.

Another concern is that is a Flash 5 swf. Would you need a Flash 8  
version as well?

Not certain of the verbiage needed for such licensing. Do you have a  
"standard" agreement I might me able to tailor to this request?

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,

Russ Taber
