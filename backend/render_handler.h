/// \page render_handler_intro Render handler introduction
///
/// Information for writing new render handlers:
///
/// There are two ways to write a new render handler:
/// - either you write a handler that must only be able to draw line strips and
///   and triangles (with various fill styles, however). This we call a 
///   triangulating render handler.
/// - or your handler can deal with the special fill style Flash uses directly,
///   which does *not* apply to most hardware accelerations. In this case the
///   unaltered original shapes are passed to the renderer, which is responsible
///   of drawing them correctly. 
///
/// For triangulating render handlers, see gnash::triangulating_render_handler
/// (defined in render_handler_tri.h), otherwise read on...
///
/// The most important thing about drawing Flash shapes is to understand how 
/// their fill styles work. 
/// A single Flash character can contain any number shapes that use any number
/// of different fill styles and line styles. The shapes of a character are 
/// defined by a number of "paths". Some important things about paths:
///
/// - A path is a list of connected straight lines and (quadratic bezier) 
///   curves (=edges). Interesting to note is that in the Flash world there are 
///   *no* primitive objects like circles, rectangles or similar. These objects 
///   are always translated to lines and curves (a circle is a set of eight 
///   curves).
///            
/// - All paths together must by definition always build a fully closed shape. 
///   You can't draw a rectangle with three edges, for example, contrary to 
///   most graphics library polygon routines that connect the last anchor to
///   the first. However, a *single* path does *not* have to be closed. The
///   missing parts may be defined by other paths (you will see this makes
///   sense).
/// 
/// - Each path has up to two fill styles and no or one line style. The line
///   style should be obvious. The two fill styles define the fill to the left
///   (fill style zero) and to the right (fill style one) of the path if you
///   think of it like a vector. The fill style is defined by a index to a 
///   list of previously defined fill style definitions. Index 0 means "no 
///   style" and is equal to a fully transparent fill style ("hole", if you 
///   wish).
///
/// - Paths are *never* self-intersecting. 
///   
///  Simple examples to understand this concept:
///
///  - A rectangle that contains another rectangle. Only the area between the 
///    two rectangles is filled (so it looks like a "o"). In this case Flash
///    fill create two paths (one for each rectangle) and one fill style. Assume
///    both paths come in clockwise order, then the outer rectangle will have
///    fillstyle0=0 and fillstyle1=1. The inner rectangle will have 
///    fillstyle0=1 and fillstyle1=0.
///
/// \code
///      +--------------------------------+
///      |XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|
///      |XXX+------------------------+XXX|
///      |XXX|                        |XXX|
///      |XXX+------------------------+XXX|
///      |XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|
///      +--------------------------------+
/// \endcode
///
///  - A rectangle is divided vertically in two halves, both having different
///    colors:
///
/// \code
///      +-------A-------+-------B--------+
///      |...............|################|
///      A...............C################B
///      |...............|################|
///      +-------A-------+-------B--------+
/// \endcode
///
///    Flash will probably produce three paths (A,B,C) and two fill styles.
///    Paths "A" and "B" will have just one fill style (fillstyle1 will be 
///    zero) while path "C" (which contains only one straight line!!) will
///    have two fill styles. To be exact the horizontal edges would not even
///    be necessary to render this shape (for a scanline based renderer) but 
///    they are necessary then the character is about to be rotated.
///
/// Now, these are simple examples but complex graphics can be compressed very
/// efficiently this way. Also, this method was most probably intended for a
/// renderer engine that can produce the final character in just one pass 
/// (like the AGG backend does too).    

  
/// \page region_update Detection of updated regions
///
/// (this applies to the whole Gnash playback architecture)
///
/// After advancing the root movie (see gnash::Gui::advance_movie) it is checked
/// which region of the stage has been changed visibly (by computing the 
/// bounds around updated characters). This has two advantages:
/// 
/// 1st, it allows a renderer/gui combination to avoid re-rendering of
/// unchanged parts in the scene. When supported by the rendering engine
/// this can be a huge performance gain. The original Flash player does
/// that too, btw. Altough he is able to define multiple smaller regions
/// for one frame. This could be implemented in Gnash, too.
/// 
/// 2nd, it can detect still frames (like a stopped movie). gui.cpp can
/// detect these and completely avoid calling any rendering function.
/// 
/// Of course, the most critical part is detection of changes. There is a 
/// method gnash::character::set_invalidated() which gets called whenever a
/// critical property of a instance gets updated, like when it changes
/// position, for example.
/// It's really important to *always* call set_invalidated() *before* 
/// any call that changes the character instance in a visible way.
/// 
/// Even if no renderer really uses this information it has effects when
/// skipping unchanged frames. If necessary, this feature can be switched
/// off easily in gui.cpp (maybe using a runtime option?).
///
/// Note the updated region is only passed to the gnash::Gui, which is itself 
/// responsible of informing the renderer (see gnash::Gui::set_invalidated_region).
/// This is because it's pointless
/// to have a renderer which updates only a small part of the stage when
/// the GUI shows it all since the area around the region is undefined.
/// However, there can be a GUI which supports update regions without needing
/// the renderer to do so (for example, to save time during blitting).
/// The GUI can also completely ignore the region information. 
///
/// It's also importanto to note that the bounds passed to the GUI are just
/// a hint and the GUI /is/ allowed to further process and alter the information
/// in any way.
/// 
/// As for the integer/float discussion: I used rect (floats) because all
/// the bounds calculation involves floats anyway and so it's probably
/// faster than converting between ints and floats all the way.
