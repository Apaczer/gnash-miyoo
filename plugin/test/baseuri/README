These files are a test for resolution of relative urls
with different mixes of <base> tags and "base" params
and subdir layouts.

The test is not automated, but if you build test.swf in both
root and sub/ dirs (top line of test.as contains makeswf call)
you'll have instructions about what to expect written in the
html page.

As a facility, some javascript code shows what's the supposed
baseURI to use for resolving relative urls.
