  There is a simple, but crude interface between the plugin and Gnash
running standalone, that supports the ExternalInterface ActionScript
class. This is currently purely ASCII based, although it wouldn't be
hard to change to a binary protocol. The bandwidth is minor, and XML
would be overkill, so for now it's just text keywords, delimited by
spaces.

SetVariable( variableName, value )
   Sets the value of the Flash variable specified by variableName to
   the value specified by value. The argument type for both arguments
   is string. 

	"Command Name Type Length value\n",
		ie... "SetVariable var1 string 6 value1\n"

GetVariable( varName )
   Returns the value of the Flash variable specified by
   varName. Returns null if the variable does not exist. The argument
   type is string. 

	"Command Name\n", ie... "GetVariable var1\n"

PercentLoaded()
   Returns the percent of the Flash Player movie that has streamed
   into the browser so far; possible values are from 0 to 100. 

	"Command\n", ie... "PercentLoaded\n"

Zoom( percent )
   Zooms the view by a relative scale factor specified by percent.
   Zoom(50) doubles the size of the objects in the view. Zoom(200)
   reduces the size of objects in the view by one half. Zoom(0) resets
   the view to 100%.

	"Command number\n", ie... "Zoom 200\n"

GotoFrame( frameNumber )
   Activates the frame number specified by frameNumber in the current
   movie. If the data for a requested frame is not yet available, the
   player goes to the last frame available and stops, causing
   unexpected results during playback. Use the PercentLoaded() method
   to determine if enough of the movie is available to execute the
   GotoFrame() method.

	"Command number\n", ie... "GotoFrame 77\n"

IsPlaying()
   Returns true if the movie is currently playing.

	"Command\n", ie... "IsPlaying\n"

movie.Play();
  Starts the movie playing.

	"Command\n", ie... "Play\n"

movie.Rewind();
  Goes to the first frame.

	"Command\n", ie... "Rewind\n"

SetZoomRect ( left, top, right, bottom )
   Zooms in on a rectangular area of the movie. The units of the
   coordinates are in twips (1440 units per inch). To calculate a
   rectangle in Flash, set the ruler units to Points and multiply the
   coordinates by 20 to get twips.

	"Command left top right bottom\n", ie... "SetZoomRect 0 0 10 10\n"
