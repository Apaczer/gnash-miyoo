  There is a simple, but crude interface between the plugin and Gnash
running standalone, that supports the ExternalInterface ActionScript
class. This is currently purely ASCII based, although it wouldn't be
hard to change to a binary protocol. The bandwidth is minor, and XML
would be overkill, so for now it's just text keywords, delimited by
spaces. A CR is used to terminate each message.

SetVariable( Name, Value )
   Sets the value of the Flash variable specified by Name to
   Value. The value is everything from the last delimiter to the end
   of the line.
   
   Sends:
	"Command Name Type value\n",
		ie... "SetVariable var1 string value1\n"
   Receives:
	nothing

GetVariable( Name )
   Returns the value of the Flash variable specified by Name. Returns
   null if the variable does not exist.

   Sends:
	"Command Name\n", ie... "GetVariable var1\n"

   Receives:
	"Command Name Type value", ie... "GetVariable var1 string value1\n"

PercentLoaded()
   Returns the percent of the Flash Player movie that has streamed
   into the browser so far; possible values are from 0 to 100. 

   Sends:
	"Command\n", ie... "PercentLoaded\n"

   Receives:
	"Command number\n", ie... "PercentLoaded 23\n"

Zoom( percent )
   Zooms the view by a relative scale factor specified by percent.
   Zoom(50) doubles the size of the objects in the view. Zoom(200)
   reduces the size of objects in the view by one half. Zoom(0) resets
   the view to 100%.

   Sends:
	"Command number\n", ie... "Zoom 200\n"

   Receives:
	nothing

GotoFrame( frameNumber )
   Activates the frame number specified by frameNumber in the current
   movie. If the data for a requested frame is not yet available, the
   player goes to the last frame available and stops, causing
   unexpected results during playback. Use the PercentLoaded() method
   to determine if enough of the movie is available to execute the
   GotoFrame() method.

   Sends:
	"Command number\n", ie... "GotoFrame 77\n"

   Receives:
	nothing

IsPlaying()
   Returns true if the movie is currently playing.

   Sends:
	"Command\n", ie... "IsPlaying\n"

   Receives:
	"Command Flag", ie... "IsPlaying true\n"

Play();
  Starts the movie playing.

   Sends:
	"Command\n", ie... "Play\n"

   Receives:
	nothing

Rewind();
   Goes to the first frame.

   Sends:
	"Command\n", ie... "Rewind\n"

   Receives:
	nothing

SetZoomRect ( left, top, right, bottom )
   Zooms in on a rectangular area of the movie. The units of the
   coordinates are in twips (1440 units per inch). To calculate a
   rectangle in Flash, set the ruler units to Points and multiply the
   coordinates by 20 to get twips.

   Sends:
	"Command left top right bottom\n", ie... "SetZoomRect 0 0 10 10\n"

   Receives:
	nothing


LoadMovie( layer, url )
   Loads the movie identified by url to the layer specified by
   layerNumber.  The argument type is integer for layer and
   string for url.
 
   Sends:
	"Command Layer Url\n", ie... "LoadMovie 1 /foo.swf\n"

   Receives:
	nothing

 StopPlay()
   Stops playing the movie.

   Sends:
	"Command StopPlay\n", ie... "StopPlay\n"

   Receives:
	nothing

TotalFrames()
   Returns the total number of frames in the movie.

   Sends:
	"Command TotalFrames\n", ie... "TotalFrames\n"

   Receives:
	"Command Num\n", ie... "TotalFrames 1234\n"

Pan ( x, y, mode ) 
   Pans a zoomed-in movie to the coordinates specified by x and y. Use
   mode to specify whether the values for x and y are pixels or a
   percent of the window. When mode is either pixels or percent of the
   window.

   Sends:
	"Command Pan x y mode\n", ie... "Pan 10 10 pixels\n"

   Receives:
   	nothing

---------------

  Many of the methods don't supposedly have a return value, so for now
commands are sent blindy, and the only ones that expect a response at
all are few. To be more tightly coupled, (I figured loosely coupled is
ok for now) every command sent should get an boolean back stating
whether the command worked correctly on the GNash side of things.

  For methods that don't appear to return anything, the result
NPVariant data is set to true or false just in case.
