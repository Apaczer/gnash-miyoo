2008-09-03  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9665] Reintroduce MIT_SHM for agg (was forced off); testsuite
	(matrix) cleanups; remoting cleanups

2008-09-03  bastiaan <bastiaan@rimmer>

	[9664] Use boost's numeric conversion instead of trunc to improve
	portability. This should not result in a change of behaviour.

2008-09-03  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9663] Failing tests for try.

2008-09-03  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9662] add tag interface to MediaParser; implement it in FLVParser and
	use from NetStreamFfmpeg

2008-09-02  Russell Nelson <nelson@nelson-desktop>

	[9661] removing -fshort-wchar; we need to use it only on the NPAPI

2008-09-02  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9660] Small cleanups.

2008-09-02  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9659] Cleanups in amf::Element class and libmedia

2008-09-01  Russell Nelson <nelson@nelson-desktop>

	[9658] Changes needed to make --enable-xpcom to compile on Gutsy
	Gibbon

2008-09-01  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9657] Use a single stack (VM-owned) for ActionScript execution

2008-09-01  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9656] Fix segfault when video pitch is not a multiple of 4. Fix
	segfault when decoder setup fails for embedded video. Don't abort when
	an unknown codec is encountered; instead, log error, fail to construct
	a VideoDecoder, and continue. Also don't construct a VideoDecoder when
	other fatal errors occur.  Add MediaException class for use in
	libmedia.

2008-09-01  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9655] some missing unimplemented messages and args marshalling
	optimization

2008-09-01  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9654] Remove obsolete code.

2008-08-31  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9653] Use an appropriate size_type for SafeStack so that it is always
	guaranteed to be valid (although the stack size is never likely to
	exceed an unsigned int).  Make more members private, which ought to
	fix any visibility problems. There's something wrong if private
	members need to be exported, and it builds fine for me now with
	visibility support enabled.  Comment out unused variables in obsolete
	functions.

2008-08-31  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9652] fix std::min() as suggested by Bastiaan. TODO: Fix Debugger.cpp

2008-08-31  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9651] visbility fix

2008-08-30  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9650] Fix std:min on BSD

2008-08-30  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9649] Change AVM1 stack management to allow smashing as expected. Fix
	build with older ffmpeg.

2008-08-28  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9648] Convert VP6A video to image::ImageRGBA. This only succeeds with
	SwScale, not with older versions of ffmpeg.  Make renderers accept but
	ignore RGBA data. It is easy to get agg to render the RGBA images,
	slightly harder to get it to handle both RGB and RGBA, and so far I
	don't see how to get it to handle transparency correctly.

2008-08-28  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9647] Fix for bug #24144. It isn't very elegant, but should work
	until FLVParser gets some much needed attention.

2008-08-28  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9646] Drop the unused half of NetConnection so that it's clear how
	the class  works and what it's for. Some minor cleanups to logging and
	code. Use smart pointers when it's useful.  Allocate a SwsContext for
	each instance of the VideoDecoderFfmpeg class so that newer versions
	of Ffmpeg can decode more than one NetStream simultaneously. Make sure
	it's freed on destruction. The ifdefs make the code a bit messier, but
	that's ffmpeg's fault for changing its API.

2008-08-26  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9645] Add test for effects of setting _width on _xscale and _height
	on _yscale

2008-08-26  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9644] Minor optimizations and removal of unused functions.

2008-08-26  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9643] Fix the matrix regression (youtube, potlatch and friends). See
	bug #24094 and bug #21756.

2008-08-25  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9642] fix up the annoinlgy failing testcase

2008-08-25  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9641] Reduce XMLSocket code, various bugfixes and AS compatibility
	corrections.  Improve tests.

2008-08-25  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9640] Stub unimplemented XMLNode functions.

2008-08-25  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9639] Fix ffmpeg version detection for deb-based packages

2008-08-25  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9638] Some maintenance on XMLSocket class.  Tests for XMLNode.
	Update swfdec testsuite results.

2008-08-22  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9637] Fix build bug.

2008-08-22  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9636] Remerge of last few commits for the sake of the log messages.

2008-08-22  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9635] Apparently a partial merge doesn't include all the individual
	commit messages, which is rubbish and makes it hard to see what I've
	done, so I'm reverting and recommitting this.

2008-08-22  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9634] Missed in last merge.

2008-08-22  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9633] Fixes to Math class, cleanup in as_value.cpp.

2008-08-22  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9632] Progress in making tu_file redundant. It is now an ordinary
	derived class of IOChannel, with no custom callbacks, and is only used
	for opening files or file descriptors so can be replaced easily with
	anything  suitable.

2008-08-22  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9631] Some cleanups.

2008-08-21  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9630] Drop temporary debug logging, add ostream operator<< for
	event_id.

2008-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9629] Partial fix and major cleanup for XMLSocket. It is unfinished,
	but appears to fix a crash occurring whenever XMLSocket.onXML() is
	called (that is, when XMLSocket.onData is undefined), gets onData
	generally correct, and produces some sensible output for onXML.
	Remove non-existent names from namedStrings.

2008-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9628] Minor cleanups only.

2008-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9627] Refine the test and make it a bit more robust.

2008-08-20  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9626] Add a Perl XMLSocket server and a self-contained test for
	XMLSocket.onData, which Gnash fails.  The server must be running
	before the SWF starts. It sends back everything it receives, replacing
	certain patterns with \n or \0.  Does anyone have any idea how to
	automate this?

2008-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9625] Use tRNS block, setting the image type to RGBA when it's used.

2008-08-19  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9624] Fix build with older versions of ffmpeg (which will abort if
	they encounter a VP6A video).

2008-08-19  Markus Gothe <markus@Coetzee>

	[9623] Leave out rtmpget

2008-08-19  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9622] Fixed building

2008-08-19  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9621] tidy up

2008-08-19  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9620] Use csignal instead of signal.h

2008-08-19  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9619] rtmpget added, take 1

2008-08-19  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9618] merge from rtmp branch.

2008-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9617] We use our own isNaN() now, not any non-standard isnan (whether
	or not it is in namespace std), and that it what we should test.

2008-08-18  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9616] use namespace std for isnan

2008-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9615] Some abstractions and class clean-ups to make implementing
	transparent video possible.  Fix gstreamer again, which subclasses
	ImageBase (this seems unnecessary,  but it needs an immediate fix).

2008-08-18  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9614] More image abstraction, cleanup, and removal of unused code.

2008-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9613] Clean up some silly as_value constructors.

2008-08-17  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9612] Use trunk instead of cvs in the version string.

2008-08-17  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9611] Add some missing NAN->NaN and a missing
	INFINITY->numeric_limits<double>:: infinity().

2008-08-16  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9610] Don't use bogus test case as it has 64bit issues as well.

2008-08-16  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9609] Fix isnan conflict by renaming rather than undefining it. Drop
	other reliance on macros that may or may not exist and use our own
	methods everywhere.

2008-08-16  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9608] Include pthread.h, so it'll compile on the latest OpenBSD

2008-08-16  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9607] Cast squareDistance() to a double, whioch sqrt wants.

2008-08-16  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9606] Use -lm when looking for finite or isfinite as they are link
	tests.

2008-08-15  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9605] Minor cleanups in FreetypeGlyphsProvider. Drop unused function.

2008-08-15  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9604] Only use -Wextra for strict compiling.

2008-08-15  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9603] Decode the MetaData tag in the video stream. FLVParser needs to
	be fixed to pass in the entire packet before this will work 100%.

2008-08-15  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9602] Properly handle meta data tags without the leading type field.

2008-08-15  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9601] Add test cases for decoding meta tag headers without the
	leading type field.

2008-08-15  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9600] Change png to libpng, so it works with pkg-config.

2008-08-15  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9599] include boost/bin.hpp too

2008-08-15  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9598] undef isnan, otherwise we get conflicts on NetBSD.

2008-08-15  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9597] Use older version of the test case that actually compiles.

2008-08-15  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9596] Recompute matrix from parameters on update. Fixes MovieClip.as
	but still not potlatch.

2008-08-15  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9595] make check fixes and mit-shm leak fix (bug #24068)

2008-08-15  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9594] Cache matrix parameters in character instances.

2008-08-14  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9593] Let BitmapMovieDefinition take RGBA as well as RGB images,
	which allows creating transparent bitmap characters from PNG,
	potentially from GIF (not yet implemented) and should make
	implementing MovieClip.attachBitmap() possible.  Restore the clone()
	method of ImageBase, as I'm not sure it was a good idea to drop it.

2008-08-14  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9592] Fix cairo and ogl builds (oops).

2008-08-14  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9591] Merge from rtmp branch the new flvdumper utility, various other
	libamf patches, and some new test cases.

2008-08-13  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9590] Do PNG reading better.

2008-08-13  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9589] Various image-related bugfixes and improvements.

2008-08-13  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9588] We need to link against GIF_LIBS too.

2008-08-12  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9587] Bugfix to PNG image input.

2008-08-12  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9586] collision detection fixes, minor cleanups to remoting

2008-08-12  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9585] Merge new XPCOM support from branch.

2008-08-12  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9584] Fix remoting for GC, cleanups, fix support for short
	PLACEOBJECT tag

2008-08-12  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9583] improve headers parsing

2008-08-12  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9582] Fix 404 handling with non-blocking read (well, kind-of).
	Improve remoting by dropping any string_table lookups and properly
	handle 404.

2008-08-12  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9581] Write an RGBA image if an image::rgba is passed.

2008-08-12  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9580] Initial remoting support. Needs further cleanup, test and
	improvement .

2008-08-12  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9579] Minor cleanups to ImageOutput.

2008-08-12  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9578] Attempt to fix the Debian Etch build.

2008-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9577] Provide a unified image-writing interface: ImageOutput. Bring
	JPEG writing under this structure and implement PNG writing. I see no
	point in implementing GIF writing.  There are no users of these yet.
	They will write any valid image_base (presently just image::rgb) to
	the provided IOChannel.

2008-08-11  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9576] Rename stream.{h,cpp} to SWFStream.{h,cpp} to reflect the class
	name.  Add constructor to sprite_definition.cpp for creating an empty
	MovieClip; the SWFStream can then be passed by reference like
	everywhere else.

2008-08-10  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9575] Pass SWFStream always by reference, except in a couple of cases
	where a  NULL pointer has a meaning.  This is an unfinished general
	cleanup to take SWFStream always by reference instead of a mixture of
	pointers and references, with some classes having hacks to convert one
	to the other. It's being committed because others are also working on
	parsing and need to adapt them to this  tag loader interface change.

2008-08-10  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9574] update from branch, XPI packaging now works.

2008-08-10  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9573] Add actionscript.all and libnet.all into DIST_SUBDIRS Ming
	release rc1 is *after* beta5.

2008-08-09  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9572] Delete unused files in doc/C. I keep wasting time editing the
	wrong ones.  Update the correct files with current information.

2008-08-08  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9571] Some cleanups, drop unused functions.  Parse and implement
	DefineButtonCxform tag (SWF2 only).

2008-08-08  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9570] Restore support for SWF2 (PlaceObject tag), which stopped
	working sometime between 2006 and now.

2008-08-08  rob@welcomehome.org

	[9569] Newer version of ffmpeg use LIBAVCODEC_VERSION_TRIPLET instead
	of LIBAVCODEC_VERSION.

2008-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9568] Parse CSMTextSettings tag (used by myspace).

2008-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9567] Fix for a segfault in sound_handler_sdl.cpp.  Drop some unused
	functions.

2008-08-07  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9566] Minor addition to image cleanup.  Drop SIZET_FMT everywhere.

2008-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9565] Unify and clean up the image input interface.

2008-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9564] Add an interlaced gif in the test suite.

2008-08-06  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9563] Add GIF reading support, improve PNG reading support. Both are
	now a  subclass of ImageInput, which keeps format complications well
	away from the core.

2008-08-05  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9562] Manual test for loading gifs.

2008-08-05  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9561] Clean up logging.

2008-08-05  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9560] Add PNG-reading capabilities. This is only for PNG movies;
	there isn't a way of embedding them in a SWF (at least up to version
	8).  There still might be something to be said for unifying the
	interface to JPEG and PNG.

2008-08-04  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9559] Fix xtrace to also do off-visual trace

2008-08-04  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9558] First draft of an haxe-based testing framework plus some
	distribution fixes (looks like we weren't distributing the testsuite
	if configure didn't find the required tools to run them !)

2008-08-04  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9557] Enable toString() counting tests.

2008-08-04  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9556] Minor cleanup to gui code.  Log unimplemented when trying to
	jump to before the tag start. This gives a lot of logging when a movie
	is thoroughly obfuscated, but that corresponds to the way the SWF
	looks when it plays.

2008-08-04  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9555] SimpleBuffer and cross-blocks branching

2008-08-03  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9554] Give dump gui the C++ treatment. Minor cleanups to
	extention.cpp, comment on implementation of edit_text_character.cpp.

2008-08-01  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9553] Fix autogen.

2008-08-01  Russell Nelson <nelson@nelson-desktop>

	[9552] Fix typo in advice about libming-util

2008-07-31  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9551] Minor cleanups.

2008-07-31  Russell Nelson <nelson@nelson-desktop>

	[9550] Be more paranoid about ming versions

2008-07-31  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9549] Complete implementation of string methods with SWF5 to
	upper/lower. Improve String.toUpper and .toLower. Both need more work.

2008-07-30  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9548] New swfdec tests.

2008-07-30  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9547] Drop -ansi again.

2008-07-30  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9546] Cleanups of extension handling, replace C-style implementation
	with (unoptimized) C++ one. It won't be a bottleneck, but some further
	cleanup would be fine.  Other minor cleanups.  Restore -ansi now that
	some non-standard functions have gone and see how far the win32 build
	gets.

2008-07-30  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9545] Cleanup of extension / module / plugin loading, part I.

2008-07-30  Dossy Shiobara <dossy@panoptic.com>

	[9544] * configure.ac: MinGW gcc 3.4.5 on Win32 won't build with
	-ansi,   which undefines things like strdup, etc.  *
	libbase/Makefile.am: Win32 builds fail when linking against
	libltdl.dll.a, as it's missing the lt_* symbols.  Need to look   into
	this further, but in the meantime, this gets the build   going again.
	* libbase/utility.h: GetCurrentThreadId@0 symbol in kernel32.dll
	needs to be defined outside of the gnash C++ namespace.   Needless to
	say, this change is a fragile hack to get the   build moving again.  *
	libmedia/MediaParser.cpp: usleep() not available on Win32.   This
	should probably go into utility.h or some other platform   abstraction
	lib.

2008-07-29  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9543] Catch actionlimits exception thrown in executeTimers.

2008-07-28  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9542] Array fixes and negative matrix scale tests

2008-07-28  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9541] Tom's avm2 patches

2008-07-25  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9540] Some minor improvements to BitmapData. This needs more testing.

2008-07-25  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9539] A bit more BitmapData.

2008-07-25  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9538] check fixes

2008-07-25  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9537] More tests for instance construction, minor change to
	BitmapData.

2008-07-24  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9536] comment might be threated as part of the preprocessor-statement

2008-07-24  Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	[9535] Removed all .cvsignore

2008-07-24  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9534] fix most of bwy new testcases (more needed)

2008-07-24  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9533] another "check" fix

2008-07-24  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9532] Tests for instance construction.

2008-07-23  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9531] Minor cleanups / Makefile bugfix.

2008-07-23  Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	[9530] Fix 'make check' and runs with sound disabled

	there.

2008-07-18  Benjamin Wolsey <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	[9499] Add a group of tests for depth limits. Do depth checking on

	just 0-65535. Don't use depth as ID.  Add static constants to

	files and utility.cpp.

2008-07-15  Russell Nelson <nelson@nelson-desktop>
