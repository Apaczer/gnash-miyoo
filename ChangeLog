	* macros/sdl.m4: Store the compilation flags so the compilation
	tests works on ppc-linux.

2006-01-21 Michael Carlson <corfe83dev@gmail.com>

        * server/action.cpp: Initial implementation of as_array_object
        ( get_member, set_member, push, pop, and length )
	
2006-01-20  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* backend/Makefile.am: Make the OGL and SDL support a library so
	it can also be used by the plugin.
	* libbase/Makefile.am: Add SDL_MIXER_CFLAGS to the include paths.
	* macros/sdl.m4: Correct typo so --with-sdl_mixer-lib actually
	works. Add /usr/bin/X11 to the default search path for
	sdl-config.
	* server/styles.cpp: Print a better error message wh.en a bad
	gradient value is read before aborting.

2006-01-19  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	and nodelay.

	* testsuite/movies.all/ORIGIN: List where all these movies came
	from originally.
	* testsuite/movies.all/elvis.swf: Dancing figures movie. Makes a
	decent performance test.

2006-01-07  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/impl.cpp (gnash): Use unsigned int for for loops so we
	don't have problems with comparing integers.

2006-01-07  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/plugin.cpp (eventThread): Add background thread for
	processing flash movies. Merge in OpenGL/SDL support from the
	standalone player. Start a thread for each new stream.

2006-01-06  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/sound_handler_mp3.cpp: Build if libmad exists.
	* configure.ac: Rearrange the final display lines, and the order
	some of the tests are done in. Look for libmad.
	* backend/Makefile.am: Add OpenGL flags so Darwin is happy.
	* libgeometry/Makefile.am:  Add OpenGL flags so Darwin is happy.
	* server/Makefile.am: Add sound_handler_mp3.cpp.

	* macros/opengl.m4: Rewrite completely. Add --with-opengl optins
	for the paths, and also make --disable-opengl work correctly.

	* libgeometry/geometry.h(math): Rename _X, _Y, or _Z because on
	Darwin they conflict with system header definitions.

	* configure.in, config.h.in, all Makefiles.in: Remove generated
	files from CVS. Running autogen.sh will regenerate them.

2006-01-05  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/action.cpp: Cast to void * to print the pointer address.

	* libbase/triangulate.h: Migrate patch from GameSWF.
	* libbase/triangulate_impl.h:  Migrate patch from GameSWF.
	* libbase/triangulate_float.cpp:  Migrate patch from GameSWF.
	* libbase/triangulate_sint32.cpp:  Migrate patch from GameSWF.

2005-12-27  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Add sections on software dependancies,
	configuring, installing, and running Gnash.
	
	* server/Makefile.am: Don't install the libraries in a package
	subdirectory of $libdir.
	* libbase/Makefile.am: Don't install the libraries in a package
	subdirectory of $libdir.
	* libgeometry/Makefile.am: Don't install the libraries in a
	package subdirectory of $libdir.

	* autogen.sh: If any command arguments are supplied, don't run
	automake, as nothing has changed but the configure script. This is
	to reduce clutter in the checkin messages when only a configure
	change has been made.

	* macros/libXML.m4: Don't look for XML libraries in the prefix
	directory.
	* macros/firefox.m4: Don't look for Firefox libraries in the
	prefix directory.

2005-12-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add doc subdirectory to DIST_SUBDIRS so it gets
	included in the tarball, but isn't part of the SUBDIRS, since we
	don't always want to build the docs.

	* macros/libXML.m4: Make the --with-libxml-include and
	--with-libxml-libraries add the library to the path. Test if
	pk-config exists. Use it if it does, but if it doesn't, do a brute
	force check of standard install locations for the XML2 headers and
	library.

	* backend/gnash.cpp: Define gofast and goslow here instead of
	xmlsocket.cpp.
	* server/xmlsocket.cpp: Reference gofast and goslow as externs so
	gnash actually builds with --disable-xml.

2005-12-25  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/plugin.cpp: Fix plugin name so it's recognized correctly
	to play flash movies looking for the proprietary Flash
	player. Instead of rendering the flash movie, copy the byte stream
	to /tmp instead so we can collect more test cases.

	* configure.ac: Fix the --disable-xml option so it actually
	works.

2005-12-21  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/firefox.m4: Move enable test to here. If firefox-config
	doesn't exist, look for mozilla-config. If neither exists, the
	plugin won't be built as the mozilla development headers and
	libraries aren't installed.
	* Makefile.am: Don't try to build the plugin if the mozilla
	development SDK isn't installed.

	* config.h.in: Checkin header file produced by autoheader so Gnash
	builds on machines without the Autotools installed.
	* doc/C/images/car_crash.txt: Add file for alt text so conversion
	to info works correctly.

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Update legal notices.
	* doc/C/fdl-appendix.xml: Add FDL in DocBook format.

2005-12-20  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* libbase/Makefile.am, libgeometry/Makefile.am,
	server/Makefile.am: Don't install the headers.
	* plugin/mozilla-sdk/Makefile.am: Install the SDK library.

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Add more content beyond just the command line
	arguments. Add a screenshot of the car crash test case.
	* configure.ac: Drop the plugin/test directory, it's unused for
	now.

2005-12-11  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/xml.cpp, xml.h: Update copyright notice.
	* server/xmlsocket.cpp, xmlsocket.h: Update copyright notice.

2005-12-10  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* AUTHORS, README, NEWS: Add content.
