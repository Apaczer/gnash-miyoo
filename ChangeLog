	* doc/C/netconnection.xml: Update with more detailed data on this
	class.

	* server/NetConnection.cpp: Implement part of the connect()
	method. Add C++ accessor methods as AS methods, and we can call
	our custom methods from testing code to examine the internal state
	of a class.
	* server/NetConnection.h: Add C++ accessor methods as AS methods,
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/NetConnection.as: Test the connect()

	reduce the chance of name collision.
	* server/Makefile.am: Rename libserver to libgnashserver, and
	libasobjs to libgnashasobjs to reduce the chance of name
	collision. 
	* backend/Makefile.am: Rename libgbackend to libgnashbackend to
	reduce the chance of name collision. Use the new library names to
	link.
	* utilities/Makefile.am: Use the new library names to link.
	* plugin/Makefile.am: Rename libgnash to be libgnashplugin to
	reduce the chance of name collision. Use the new library names to

	and rename the unsupported ones to have a "_fixme" attached when
	printing debug information.
	* backend/Makefile.am (AM_LDFLAGS): Add $(X_LIBS) so we can link
	with libraries in /usr/X11R6/lib.

	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): Add so autoreconf works. 

	* server/action.cpp: Add missing opcodes to opcode table so we can
	at least know when they get invoked.

2006-02-03 Michael Carlson <corfe83dev@gmail.com>

	* server/action.cpp: SetTarget is now implemented for targets
	other than ""
	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: use TWIPS_TO_PIXELS macro
	instead of hardcoded 20 value

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Function.as: tests for user-defined
	  class definition
	* server/swf.h: moved SWF namespace definition in it's own header,

	  ACTION_IMPLEMENTS tag_types, added dox on some action_types.
	* server/action.cpp: used symbolic names for SWF action tag ids
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Object.as: test for Object class
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Makefile.am: added support for
	  user-defined flags to ``makeswf'' invocation
	  (for -DUSE_XTRACE, mainly)
	* libbase/: image.h, jpeg.h: Doxygen-compatible comments

2006-02-03 Michael Carlson <corfe83dev@gmail.com>

	NaN on division by zero
	* server/Date.h: Setup basic time storage variables
	* server/Date.cpp: Implement default constructor, basic time
	reading operations

2006-02-02  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Makefile.am: Use the standard
	automake way to build the test cases.

	* Makefile.am (STD_DIRS): Remove testsuite. Nothing actually needs
	to be done at "make all" time anyway. So now the testuites can
	only be run from the testsuite subdirctory.
	* macros/png.m4: Fix various typos and other stupid errors that
	kept the --with-png-incl and --with-png-lib options from working
	correctly.
	* configure.ac: Tweak test for PNG support.

2006-02-01  Rob Savoye  <rob@cree.moongulch.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/gen-test.sh: Developer utility script
	that uses the NOTES file to generate a Ming style "as" source file,
	which can be used to test an ActionScript class.
	* server/gen-files.sh: Developer utility script that uses the
	NOTES file to generate header and source file templates for an
	ActionScript class.
	* doc/C/gen-doc.sh: Developer utility script that uses the NOTES
	file to generate a documentation template for an ActionScript
	class.
	* doc/C/NOTES: Data file for file generation scripts. This is only
	of interest to other developers. If you change this file, you may
	break the other developer gen-* scripts.
	* testsuite/Makefile.am: Add dejagnu to AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS. Reset
	RUNTESTDEFAULTFLAGS to not use the --tool option.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Makefile.am: Add dejagnu to
	AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS. Reset	RUNTESTDEFAULTFLAGS to not use the --tool
	option.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/swf_exists.exp: Test driver for
	DejaGnu to run the new test cases.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Boolean.as, Date.as, Microphone.as,
	SharedObject.as, Camera.as, Error.as, Mouse.as, Stage.as, Color.as, server/Makefile.am, backend/Makefile.am,
	Function.as, NetConnection.as, System.as, ContextMenu.as,
	LoadVars.as, NetStream.as, TextSnapshot.as, CustomActions.as,
	LocalConnection.as, Selection.as, Video.as: New Ming based test
	cases for ActionScript classes. Currently all these do is test for
	the existance of a class, and all of it's methods.
	* server/Boolean.cpp, Date.cpp,	Microphone.cpp,	SharedObject.cpp,
	Camera.cpp, Error.cpp, Mouse.cpp, Stage.cpp, Color.cpp,
	Function.cpp, NetConnection.cpp, System.cpp, ContextMenu.cpp,
	LoadVars.cpp, NetStream.cpp, TextSnapshot.cpp, CustomActions.cpp,
	LocalConnection.cpp, Selection.cpp, Video.cpp: New stubs for
	missing ActionScript classes. All they do for now is print
	"unimplemented", but as all the hard code to tie a class and it's
	methods into Gnash is done, it'll be much easier to fill in
	functionality.

2006-01-30 Michael Carlson <corfe83dev@gmail.com>

	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: tentative implementation
	of line_style_width with appropriate TODO message

2006-01-30  Rob Savoye  <rob@ripple.welcomehome.org>

	* doc/C/accessibility.xml, button.xml, camera.xml,
	contextmenu.xml, customactions.xml, date.xml,
	error.xml, internals.xml, key.xml,
	loadvars.xml, localconnection.xml,
	microphone.xml, mouse.xml, netstream.xml,
	selection.xml, sharedobject.xml, sound.xml,
	stage.xml, textsnapshot.xml, video.xml,
	xml.xml, xmlsocket.xml: Add content.
	* doc/C/accessibility.xml camera.xml, color.xml, contextmenu.xml,
	customactions.xml, date.xml, error.xml, function.xml, key.xml,
	loadvars.xml, localconnection.xml, microphone.xml, mouse.xml,
	movieclip.xml, moviecliploader.xml, netstream.xml, object.xml,
	selection.xml, sharedobject.xml, sound.xml, stage.xml, system.xml,
	textfield.xml,	textformat.xml,textsnapshot.xml. video.xml,
	xml.xml, xmlsocket.xml: New machine generated templates for
	ActionScript class documentaion.

	* doc/C/array.xml, boolean.xml, button.xml, math.xml,
	netconnection.xml, number.xml, string.xml: New docs, one for each
	ActionScript class.

2006-01-29  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* doc/C/internals.xml: Add a table of what ActionScript classes
	are implemented, and to what degree.
	* doc/C/sources.xml: Add section on PNG and JPEG dependancies. Add
	section on using Doxygen.

	* doc/Doxyfile.in (INPUT): Change to using @top_srcdir@, so the
	doxygen usage supports building the docs when configuring with a
	separate build tree from the sources.

2006-01-28  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* doc/C/internals.xml: Add section on adding new ActionScript
	classes with reasonable detail.

	* doc/C/sources.xml: New file extracted from gnash.xml, and made a
	standalone file since it's grown in size.
	* doc/C/appendix.xml: New file for Appendix content.
	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Move some sections to separete files. Include
	the new files.

	* doc/C/Makefile.am: Add pdf and info to SUFFIXES so the rules
	actually work.

	* doc/omf.make (install-data-hook-omf): Only install if you are
	root, as this requires writing to system directories.
	* configure.ac: Link the doc/C/images directory to the build
	directory so we can find images when producing output files. Check
	state of DocBook when it's enabled.
	* macros/docbook.m4: Add path to stylesheets for Ubuntu. Look for
	fop.sh, and the DocBook2X conversion tools. Make DocBook optional,
	use --enable-docbook to enable. When disableed, you can't build
	any of the docs.
	* macros/ghelp.m4: Check for Scrollkeeper tools. Using GNOME Help
	is disabled by default. Use --enable-ghelp to enable.
	* doc/C/Makefile.am: Use variables defined by configure for all
	the conversion tools.

2006-01-27  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/player.cpp: Use GLinitialized instead of
	surface_activated, which turns out to be a system definition on
	some Unixes. Make main_loop take a nsPluginInstance as an argument
	so we have all the data we need. Setup a thread to run the
	player.
	* server/Makefile.am, backend/Makefile.am,
	plugin/Makefile.am, utility/Makefile.am,
	plugin/mozilla-sdk/Makefile.am: Don't use VORBIS variables
	anymore.
	* macros/libXML.m4: Use xml2-config instead of pkg-config.
	* maxros/mad.m4: Add BSD path prefix, /usr/pkg.
	* libbase/triangulate_impl.h: Drop the long modifier when printing
	a size.
	* libbase/Makefile.am: Make dmalloc build conditionally when
	--enable-dmalloc is passed to configure.
	* backend/sound_handler_sdl.cpp: Only compile if SDL_Mixer is
	installed.
	* backend/gnash.cpp: xml_fd should always be defined. Make using
	SDL_Mixer for sound be conditional, since a machine may have SDL
	installed, but not SDL_Mixer, but we still want the player to
	build.
	* server/xmlsocket.h, xmlsocket.cpp: Include config.h as generated
	by configue if it exists.
	* server/xml.h, xml.cpp: Include config.h as generated
	by configue if it exists.
	* configure.ac: Enable test for pthread.h and libpthread. Don't
	look for Vorbis, the OGG tests are enough.
	* server/Movie.cpp, Sprite.cpp, impl.cpp, array.cpp: Include
	pthread.h to get around a data type definition problem on
	NetBSD. This seems to be required when using STL containers on
	NetBSD. 
	* macros/opengl.m4: Use mad.m4 as a template and rewrite to be
	more portable.
	* macros/png.m4: Use mad.m4 as a template and rewrite to be
	more portable.
	* macros/jpeg.m4: Use mad.m4 as a template and rewrite to be
	more portable.
	* macros/sdl.m4: Look for SDL specific directory before and after
	the include or lib since some platforms install these differently.
	* macros/pthreads.m4: Look for POSIX Thread support. This turns
	out to be very messy with NetBSD, as the old version is also
	installed, and we have to link with the right one for any
	executable to work.

2006-01-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/Makefile.am: Link in shared libraries. Install the plugin
	in the users home directory for mozilla or firefox plugins.
	* server/Makefile.am, backend/Makefile.am,
	plugin/Makefile.am, plugin/mozilla-sdk/Makefile.am: Sigh, back to
	building and installing shared libraries because AMD64-linux
	doesn't support linking the plugin with static libraries.

	* configure.ac: Don't complain about missing libxml2 libraries if
	--disable-xml was specified.
	* backend/gnash.cpp: Always define gofast and goslow, even if XML
	support is disabled.
	* libbase/tu_types.h: If the Mozilla obsolete Prototypes file has
	been included, don't redefine the 64 bit data types.

	* testsuite/movies.all/elvis.swf: Remove URL ping to spyware
	server.

	* libbase/triangulate_impl.h: Change %ld to %d in print statement.
	* libbase/tu_types.h: Use SDL typedefs always.

2006-01-24  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/opengl.m4: Update based on mad.m4 template.
	* macros/mad.m4: Fix typo, -I should be a -L.

2006-01-24 Michael Carlson <corfe83dev@gmail.com>

	* server/array.h: as_array_object now uses deque instead of vector
	* server/array.cpp: Implement array::unshift, shift, reverse,
	concat, slice, toString, join - also make push return the new
	length as it should have done before

2006-01-23  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/player.cpp, player.h: Neew file for Flash player within

	* backend/Makefile.am: Don't install the libraries.
	* plugin/Makefile.am: Don't install the
	libraries. Pass-no-undefined to libtool so all symbols are
	resolved in the final shared library.
	* plugin/mozilla-sdk/Makefile.am: Don't install the libraries.

	* configure.ac: Use new DMALLOC test.
	* macros/dmalloc.m4: New macro for dmalloc support.
	* utilities/Makefile.am: Add support for dmalloc.
	* server/Makefile.am: Add support for dmalloc.
	* backend/Makefile.am: Add support for dmalloc.
	* plugin/Makefile.am: Add support for dmalloc.
	* libbase/utility.cpp: Only build if we have mallinfo. 

2006-01-23 Michael Carlson <corfe83dev@gmail.com>

	* server/action.h: Create utility funcs as_value::is_inf, is_nan
	* server/action.cpp: Let as_value String<->Number conversions
	use NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity where appropriate
	* server/string.cpp: Make charCodeAt() return a NaN value when
	appropriate
	* server/array.cpp: Array now checks for NaN after converting
	index string to_number(), instead of the old hacked-up way

2006-01-23  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* server/styles.cpp: Fix condition for gradient test.

	* configure.ac: Remove AM_MKINSTALLDIRS macro, it's now unneeded.

	* server/array.cpp: Move new array code into array.cpp, array.h
	* server/action.cpp: Move new array code into array.cpp, array.h
	* server/Makefile.am: Move new array code into array.cpp, array.h
        * server/font.cpp: Report an error and continue when we get two
	of the same kerning pairs for a font, instead of crashing

2006-01-22  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* configure.ac: Make text at end of configure more detailed about
	dependency errors.

	* backend/Makefile.am: Add flags and libs for OGG and Vorbis as
	separete flags.
	* utilities/Makefile.am: Add flags and libs for OGG and Vorbis as
	separete flags.

	separete flags.

	* server/styles.cpp: Don't abort if we read a bad gradient.

	* macros/sdl.m4: Store the compilation flags so the compilation
	tests works on ppc-linux.

2006-01-21 Michael Carlson <corfe83dev@gmail.com>

        * server/action.cpp: Initial implementation of as_array_object
        ( get_member, set_member, push, pop, and length )
	
2006-01-20  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* backend/Makefile.am: Make the OGL and SDL support a library so
	it can also be used by the plugin.
	* libbase/Makefile.am: Add SDL_MIXER_CFLAGS to the include paths.
	* macros/sdl.m4: Correct typo so --with-sdl_mixer-lib actually
	works. Add /usr/bin/X11 to the default search path for
	sdl-config.
	* server/styles.cpp: Print a better error message wh.en a bad
	gradient value is read before aborting.

2006-01-19  Rob Savoye  <rob@wharfrat.welcomehome.org>

	* utilities/Makefile.am: Link with AM_LDFLAGS.

	from originally.
	* testsuite/movies.all/elvis.swf: Dancing figures movie. Makes a
	decent performance test.

	moviecliploader_test.swf, text_formatting.swf, text_sizes.swf,
	visible_and_transparency.swf: New test cases.

	cases.

2006-01-07  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/impl.cpp (gnash): Use unsigned int for for loops so we
	don't have problems with comparing integers.

2006-01-07  Rob Savoye  <rob@darkstar.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/plugin.cpp (eventThread): Add background thread for
	processing flash movies. Merge in OpenGL/SDL support from the

2006-01-06  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/sound_handler_mp3.cpp: Build if libmad exists.
	* configure.ac: Rearrange the final display lines, and the order
	some of the tests are done in. Look for libmad.
	* backend/Makefile.am: Add OpenGL flags so Darwin is happy.
	* libgeometry/Makefile.am:  Add OpenGL flags so Darwin is happy.
	* server/Makefile.am: Add sound_handler_mp3.cpp.

	* macros/opengl.m4: Rewrite completely. Add --with-opengl optins
	for the paths, and also make --disable-opengl work correctly.

	* libgeometry/geometry.h(math): Rename _X, _Y, or _Z because on
	Darwin they conflict with system header definitions.

	* configure.in, config.h.in, all Makefiles.in: Remove generated
	files from CVS. Running autogen.sh will regenerate them.

2006-01-05  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/action.cpp: Cast to void * to print the pointer address.

	* libbase/triangulate.h: Migrate patch from GameSWF.

	subdirectory of $libdir.
	* libgeometry/Makefile.am: Don't install the libraries in a
	package subdirectory of $libdir.

	* autogen.sh: If any command arguments are supplied, don't run
	automake, as nothing has changed but the configure script. This is
	to reduce clutter in the checkin messages when only a configure
	change has been made.

	* macros/libXML.m4: Don't look for XML libraries in the prefix
	directory.
	* macros/firefox.m4: Don't look for Firefox libraries in the
	prefix directory.

2005-12-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add doc subdirectory to DIST_SUBDIRS so it gets
	included in the tarball, but isn't part of the SUBDIRS, since we
	don't always want to build the docs.

	* macros/libXML.m4: Make the --with-libxml-include and
	--with-libxml-libraries add the library to the path. Test if
	pk-config exists. Use it if it does, but if it doesn't, do a brute
	force check of standard install locations for the XML2 headers and
	library.

	* backend/gnash.cpp: Define gofast and goslow here instead of
	xmlsocket.cpp.
	* server/xmlsocket.cpp: Reference gofast and goslow as externs so
	gnash actually builds with --disable-xml.

2005-12-25  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/plugin.cpp: Fix plugin name so it's recognized correctly
	to play flash movies looking for the proprietary Flash
	player. Instead of rendering the flash movie, copy the byte stream
	to /tmp instead so we can collect more test cases.

	* configure.ac: Fix the --disable-xml option so it actually
	works.

2005-12-21  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/firefox.m4: Move enable test to here. If firefox-config
	doesn't exist, look for mozilla-config. If neither exists, the
	plugin won't be built as the mozilla development headers and
	libraries aren't installed.
	* Makefile.am: Don't try to build the plugin if the mozilla
	development SDK isn't installed.

	* config.h.in: Checkin header file produced by autoheader so Gnash
	builds on machines without the Autotools installed.
	* doc/C/images/car_crash.txt: Add file for alt text so conversion
	to info works correctly.

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Update legal notices.
	* doc/C/fdl-appendix.xml: Add FDL in DocBook format.

2005-12-20  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* libbase/Makefile.am, libgeometry/Makefile.am,
	server/Makefile.am: Don't install the headers.
	* plugin/mozilla-sdk/Makefile.am: Install the SDK library.

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Add more content beyond just the command line
	arguments. Add a screenshot of the car crash test case.
	* configure.ac: Drop the plugin/test directory, it's unused for
	now.

2005-12-11  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/xml.cpp, xml.h: Update copyright notice.
	* server/xmlsocket.cpp, xmlsocket.h: Update copyright notice.

2005-12-10  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* AUTHORS, README, NEWS: Add content.
