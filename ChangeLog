	* plugin/plugin.cpp: Fix plugin name so it's recognized correctly
	to play flash movies looking for the proprietary Flash
	player. Instead of rendering the flash movie, copy the byte stream
	to /tmp instead so we can collect more test cases.

	* configure.ac: Fix the --disable-xml option so it actually
	works.

	* macros/firefox.m4: Move enable test to here. If firefox-config
	doesn't exist, look for mozilla-config. If neither exists, the
	plugin won't be built as the mozilla development headers and
	libraries aren't installed.
	* Makefile.am: Don't try to build the plugin if the mozilla
	development SDK isn't installed.

	* config.h.in: Checkin header file produced by autoheader so Gnash
	builds on machines without the Autotools installed.
	* doc/C/images/car_crash.txt: Add file for alt text so conversion
	to info works correctly.

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Update legal notices.
	* doc/C/fdl-appendix.xml: Add FDL in DocBook format.

2005-12-20  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* libbase/Makefile.am, libgeometry/Makefile.am,
	server/Makefile.am: Don't install the headers.
	* plugin/mozilla-sdk/Makefile.am: Install the SDK library.

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Add more content beyond just the command line
	arguments. Add a screenshot of the car crash test case.
	* configure.ac: Drop the plugin/test directory, it's unused for
	now.
