2007-11-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: make request for hildon and unavailability a nogo,
	  suggest installing libhildon-1-dev rather then libhildon.0-dev
	  for apt-get (the former exists for ubuntu gutsy, the latter

2007-11-21 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/swf4opcode.sc: found a way for better
	  test result reporting (can be improved to become a full SWF4
	  compatible Dejagnu thing - lacks actual result message so far).

	  attempt to remove a NULL pointer from the listeners set.

2007-11-21 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/as_environment.h,.cpp: Initialize _original_target, as this
	  absence was causing segfaults.  Convert the call stack to a static
	  one.
	* server/swf_function.cpp: Use a class for ensuring the call stack,
	  rather than doing so manually.
	* server/Property.h,.cpp: Initialize differently.

	  guaranteed correct through use of FrameGuard class.
	
2007-11-21 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/as_value.cpp: to_number() convert invalid float literal
	  to zero instead of NaN for swf<5.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/swf4opcode.sc: xcheck->check.
	
2007-11-21 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/swfdec/gen_run_swfdec_testsuite.sh: export
	  a GNASH_PLAYER so that swfdec_run_test may decide to
	  use gnash rather then gprocessor...

2007-11-17 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Color.cpp (color_gettransform): truncate
	  values to integers.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: color1.swf succeeds
	* testsuite/swfdec/Makefile.am: split swfdec test runners in

	  would be an ASerror, not a generic one.

2007-11-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/array.h (visitAll): copy the container before executing
	  arbitrary code while iterating over it. Fixes a memory corruption.
	* server/asobj/Key.{cpp,h}: Initialize the Key object as an usual
	  AsBroadcaster.

	* configure.ac: quote arguments of test(1)
	* server/asobj/MovieClipLoader.cpp (dispatchEvent): don't lookup

2007-11-16 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/as_object.{h,cpp}, server/asobj/Key.{h,cpp},
	  server/character.h,
	  server/button_character_instance.cpp,
	  server/edit_text_character.cpp,
	  server/movie_root.{h,cpp},

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: a couple of tests more.

2007-11-15 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: call constructAsScriptObject
	  directly rather then on_event(CONSTRUCT) when needed. Doing
	  so we can invoke the event handler *after* __proto__ is set
	  but *before* the class constructor is invoked, as reported to
	  be needed by swfdec tests.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: movieclip-set-prototype-{5,6,7,8}.swf
	  succeed.

2007-11-15 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (ActionCastOp): swap order of arguments,

	  the empty string when dangling.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: add test for convertion
	  of dangling movieclip values to a string.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: dangling-print-{6,7,8}.swf succeed now.

2007-11-15 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: construct instance on CONSTRUCT
	  event (not INITIALIZE). YouTube works, and we push all init

	  testsuite/misc-swfc.all/action_execution_order_test10.sc,
	  testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc,

	  resize to let text fit in (autoSize).
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: cleanup debugging output.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/registerclass_test3.sc: add more tests for
	  registerClass effects visibility.

2007-11-15 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/registerclass_test3.sc: add tests to for youtube
	  player2 and caught the bug.
	  
2007-11-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: sync'd with results from current swfdec
	  master branch.

2007-11-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_environment.{cpp,h}: unify object finding and target
	  finding. The code is pretty dirty but is more correct then 
	  before.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: getsetproperty-target-{6,7,8}.swf succeed
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: no more failures (we need more)
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/callFunction_test.c: two more successes, one
	  test still fails.

2007-11-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Object.cpp (object_registerClass): more informative
	  aserror messages.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: more tests.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp, server/video_stream_instance.cpp:
	  Remove some debugging output (compile-time defined)

2007-11-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: add a processingActions method,
	  might be used to know wheter to push actions or execute
	  them immediately.
	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: add an execute_init_action
	  method to be called by DoInitAction tag executor; add a
	  YOUTUBE_HAVE_PRECEDENCE macro undefining which we get lots
	  of new XPASS but break youtube... (pushing init actions
	  to action queue).
	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.cpp (add_init_action): store
	  init actions togheter with all other control tags.
	* server/swf/DoActionTag.h (execute): call execute_init_action
	  for init actions, execute them also by execute_state
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/: action_execution_order_test10.sc,
	  movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: some successes (we'd get much
	  more with YOUTUBE_HAVE_PRECEDENCE defined in sprite_instance.cpp)

2007-11-14 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/XML.as: adapt and reinclude
	  test removed with last change.

2007-11-14 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/XML.as: adapt test for CDATA node;
	  add XML comments (which should be ignored).
	* server/asobj/xml.cpp: (getXMLOptions) strip CDATA nodes
	  and just add text (fixes part of bug 21268); (extractNode)
	  drop comment nodes but continue to parse siblings (they can
	  be siblings of a text node).
	* server/asobj/xmlnode.cpp: minor cleanups, better debugging output.

2007-11-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/ButtonEventsTest.c: add self-contained
	  tests for target in user-defined and clip-defined event handlers,
	  plus setTarget('/') call when original target != the root
	  (would have failed before the fix of bug #21572).
	  Note that it takes some user interaction to trigger the
	  self-contained tests.

2007-11-14 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/PropertyList.cpp: Revert last change -- it includes new
	  code and is premature.

2007-11-14 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/asobj/Key.cpp: mark built-in properties for Key object, fix a 
	  segfault with the old key listener design.
	  
2007-11-14 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/PropertyList.cpp: Be stricter about checking for things that
	  could make insertions fail.

2007-11-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/targetPath.as: reverted last change, the
	  test was completely bogus.

2007-11-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/targetPath.as: more tests for setTarget,
	  could not reproduce the bug just fixed in find_target
	  (would need actions defined in Button or statically-placed sprites).
	* server/as_environment.cpp (find_target): "/" is the root.
	  Fixes bug #21572.

2007-11-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/registerClassTest.c: add test for the 
	  return code of registerClass.

2007-11-13 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	  _is_ already a test.)

2007-11-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/registerClassTest.c: add expected
	  number of tests run.

2007-11-13 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/XML.as: add first(!) test to check
	  whether XML nodeValues are set. Gnash fails (always null).
	  
2007-11-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/action_execution_order_test10.sc:
	  Add a couple of (failing) tests and two lines of documentation
	  (this test needs more documentation)

2007-11-13 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/asobj/Key.cpp: use new interface of get_member, fix compiling
	  the old key listener design.
	
2007-11-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/: DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp,
	  masks_test2runner.cpp: add comments about cairo successes.

2007-11-13 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/key_event_test.c, key_event_testrunner.cpp:
	  few more tests in both swf file and testrunner, invoked a bug.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/key_event_test2.c, key_event_test3.c, 
	  key_event_test4.c, key_event_test5.c, key_event_test2runner.cpp,
	  key_event_test3runner.cpp, key_event_test4runner.cpp, 
	  key_event_test5runner.cpp, KeyTest.as, KeyTest-Runner.cpp: dropped
	  10 file, we don't need them now, tests were merged to key_event_test.c.
	  
2007-11-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/StreamProvider.cpp (getStream): check security
	  for post streams too.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (loadVariables): 
	  Don't abort on not-found url. Don't check security
	  here as it will be checked by LoadVariablesThread.
	  Fixes sheepy.swf.

2007-11-12 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp: point_test_local bugfix:
	  revert last commit and align test coordinate to a grid instead;
	  commit some debug so I don't have to rewrite it again... ;)     

2007-11-12 Lucio Flavio Correa <lucio.correa@gmail.com>

	* gui/kdesup.h, gui/kde.cpp: implement setCuror (patch #6266).

2007-11-12 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/SoundFfmpeg.{cpp,h}: Add a LOADS_IN_SEPARATE_THREAD
	  macro (defined by default) to disable threading, make the
	  setupDecoder a non-static private and getAudio also private.

2007-11-12 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/SoundFfmpeg.cpp (getAudio): don't delete 
	  allocated memory twice. Fixes bug #21195.
	* gui/gnash.in: Add support for -G list for getting a list
	  of available guis.

2007-11-12 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp: point_test_local bugfix:  
	  don't detect two crossings for the point at the junction of two 
	  lines/curves. 

2007-11-12 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/shape.cpp: (pointOnCurve): quicker return for T in (0,1);
	  (withinSquareDistance): compute distance from segments, not points,
	  reducing iterations from 100 to 10 with no detectable precision
	  reduction.
	* testsuite/swfdec/swfdec_gnash_tester: it seems diff -u3 doesn't work
	  anymore (as of GNU diffutils 2.8.1)
	* server/: shape.cpp, tesselate.h: minor cleanup

2007-11-12 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/Makefile.am, key_event_test.c, key_event_testrunner.cpp:
	  merge all key related tests to key_event_test.c. deprecated key_event_test2,3,4,5
	  and KeyTest.as to speed up 'make check'.
	  
2007-11-11 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (sprite_attach_movie): mark the character
	  as dynamic before placing on stage (so stagePlacementCallback knows
	  about that); (stagePlacementCallback): don't construct as object
	  here, let that be done on INITIALIZE event; (on_event): construct
	  as ActionScript object before running INITIALIZE handlers.
	  Fixes bug #21556 (youtube regression).

2007-11-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (goto_frame): always set
	_callingFrameActions to false before calling restoreDisplayList.
	Fixes an assertion failure playing make_sleep.swf.

2007-11-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/shape.{cpp,h}: add new poinOnCurve and squareDistancePtCurve
	  static methods for gnash::edge, have path::withinSquareDistance
	  use them for curves.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: add self-contained
	  equivalent test for the previously failing one checking hitTest
	  on the green curve.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: success in
	  green curve hit test.
	* testsuite/server/EdgeTest.cpp: test edge poinOnCurve.

2007-11-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp, backend/render_handler_cairo.cpp,
	  backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp, server/shape.cpp, server/shape.h,
	  server/parser/morph2_character_def.cpp,
	  server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp:
	  Changed path and edge classes to store a point (Point2d<float>)
	  for anchor and control points.

2007-11-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: properly quote test arguments.

2007-11-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* (lots of files): typedefed gnash::point to Point2d<float>,
	  drop some unused functions and cleaned up headers a bit.

2007-11-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libgeometry/: Makefile.am, Point2d.h: initial implementation of
	  a generalized point class.
	* testsuite/libgeometry/: Makefile.am, Point2dTest.cpp: initial
	  test for the generalized point class.

2007-11-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/samples/Makefile.am: don't giveup on failure
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: add test that would have
	  exposed the just-fixed silly bug.
	* server/shape.cpp (withinSquareDistance): fixed silly bug checking
	  for lines connecting origin with end of each edge rather then
	  all edges. Prepared (but not implemented) section for curves.

2007-11-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.{cpp,h}: Add level argument to queueEvent method
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: Add level argument to pushAction*
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: Push actions with a level
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test5.c: one XPASS
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/displaylist_depths_test2.c: minor additional
	  trace

2007-11-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/registerClassTest2.c: 
	  Document the test
	* server/movie_root.cpp (dtor, clear): don't try to cleanup action queue
	  twice..
	* server/DynamicShape.h, server/parser/shape_character_def.h: 
	  override point_test_local in DynamicShape to finalize
	  the drawing (bogus, contains comment for the why and how to fix)

2007-11-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Global.as: add test for existence of
	  updateAfterEvent (gnash fails).
	* server/as_environment.cpp (find_object_{slash,dot}syntax):
	  use get_path_element instead of get_member to get next element
	  from an old-style path.
	  Fixes http://www.orgamez.com/files/swf/alphazoo.swf.
	* server/asobj/Color.cpp (color_ctor): parse first argument to
	  Color constructor as a string (if not a MovieClip).
	  Fixes http://www.lsfrench.com/school/couleur/colorepaint.swf.

2007-11-08 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: reverted because
	  that problem is still not solved (false PASS earlier)
	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp: modified point_test_local() 
	  again to solve problems with some corner cases. It still fails some
	  rare situations on very complex graphics - I'm still working on that;
	  failure reports are greatly appreciated!
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: some new PASSes 

2007-11-08 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* utilities/parser.cpp: dropped 'bool nodelay' since it's not used.

2007-11-08 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* server/as_value.cpp (doubletoString): replace C code with a c++
	  implementation that ought to do the same thing. Uses stringstream
	  and locale to imbue the result with the standard C locale, which
	  fixes problems with locales that have a comma decimal separator.
	  The test below should now pass in all locales.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Number.as: add tests for number formatting
	  based on comments in server/as_value.cpp. Presently they should fail
	  for locales with a comma decimal separator.

2007-11-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp: fix compiler warnings
	* macros/sdl.m4: strip '-L/usr/lib' only if it's a single world
	  (ie: not a substring like in -L/usr/lib64)
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: fix test,
	  self-name can't be evaluated.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/Makefile.am: make Dejagnu.sc and check.sc
	  dependencies of all .swf outputs.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/Dejagnu.sc: typo fix: __global => _global

2007-11-08 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/Dejagnu.sc: don't create such a big text field bounding 
	  box for xtrace, it would hiden all button clicks located within the bounding box. 
	  Enlarge the bounding box when needed.	 
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/opcode_guard_test3.sc: new tests. found onButtonActions
	  might not respect the opcode guard model.
	  
2007-11-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/shape_test.c: add Udog's drawing, 
	  open (upper) and closed (lower); left fill (left)
	  and right fill (right).
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/ming_utils.c (get_dejagnu_actions): don't
	  use printf to write the code into a buffer, just make the code a
	  const static const C-string.

2007-11-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: Add Udo's example drawing
	  and associated hitTest tests (xfailing)
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: Add pixel checking
	  for Udo's example drawing (xfailing due to visible stroke)

2007-11-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/DynamicShape.cpp: close filled paths on pen move and
	  ::finalize for last path.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: all pixel checking
	  succeed now. The only failures left are hitTest-related. Time to
	  resume the old point_test implementation.

2007-11-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/DynamicShape.{cpp,h}: Start new paths as new shapes
	  when beginFill is called.
	* server/shape.{cpp,h}: add interfaces for setting m_new_shape
	  both in constructors and standalone.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: fix the
	  two-overlapping squares case.

2007-11-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.cpp (display): skip display of null-sized levels.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: have '-' and '+'
	  use a step of 25% instead of 20% (easier for pixel checking);
	  add hitTest for the opposite-el case.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: add pixel
	  checking for the nested-squares cases.

2007-11-07 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* testsuite/libgeometry/snappingrangetest.cpp: update testcase
	  to match new SnappingRanges design

2007-11-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/shape.cpp: don't forget to initialize m_new_shape
	  in the overridden constructo !! This fixes uninitialized
	  memory giving unstable results with the nested-squares
	  cases in DrawingApiTest.swf
	* testsuite/libgeometry/snappingrangetest.cpp: don't
	  attempt to set snap_distance, not more existent.
	  I dunno if this makes the tests pointless (didn't
	  check), but at least allows its build. Udo ?

2007-11-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: pixel checking
	  for some invalid drawing (missing the nested squares to complete).
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: 3 more nested squares:
	  One with different edge directions for outer and inner squares
	  (which doesn't make a difference), and one with a new beginFill
	  call before drawing the second shape (which renders as two
	  overlapping squares, try using '-' and '+' to change _alpha
	  for testing).

2007-11-06 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* libgeometry/snappingrange.h: add range count limiting functionality
	  and limit to 50 ranges by default; make copy constructor work again
	  by adding getter methods for private members 	

2007-11-06 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* libgeometry/snappingrange.h: replace the distance method with a
	  more efficient area before/after comparison method; make 
	  snap_factor and single_mode private members and provide access
	  methods
	* libgeometry/Range2d.h: new getArea() function
	* gui/gui.cpp, server/character.cpp: apply snappingrange changes

2007-11-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: add self-contained test
	  for the nested-square case, showing that gnash fails in hit-testing
	  it the hole.

2007-11-06 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp: Reverted last commit because it
	  turned out that it really dropped performance (in some real world
	  cases it was up to six times slower)

2007-11-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: add another interesting
	  drawing in second drawing page (nested squares).
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/Makefile.am: MEDIADIR define must use
	  absolute path (the local sandboxes check isn't ready for relative
	  paths yet).
	* server/dlist.cpp (display): don't display masked characters
	  if invisible.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: fixed drawing
	  of invisible masked characters.

2007-11-06 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* macros/freetype.m4: clean up space before default filename.

2007-11-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: add test for
	  setMask and invisible shapes (gnash fails).

2007-11-06 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* macros/freetype.m4: use fontconfig to find a default sans font for
	  use if gnash runtime fails to find a suitable system font. Revert
	  to the old hard-coded path if fc-match fails.
	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp: take DEFAULT_FONTFILE from
	  config.h.
	
2007-11-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: add support for 'h' key
	  hitting to change visibility of currently active drawing. Exposes
	  a bug with setMask, which triggers drawing of the maskee even when
	  invisible.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: add a second drawing
	  with 3 "invalid" shapes. Hitting a number key switches between
	  the first (1) and second (2) drawing. 

2007-11-06 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>
	
	* macros/libXML.m4: Cleaned up output.

2007-11-05 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp: take outline hit test 
	  algorithm from old implementation; drop the old point_test 
	  method in favor of the new one; avoid browsing the paths
	  in point_test_local() when the point is already out of the
	  shape bounds 
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: two new PASSes

2007-11-05 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp: Pass bold and italic values
	  to fontconfig for system fonts. Fixes bug #20597. 

2007-11-05 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp: Implement a new point_test
	  algorithm (disabled by default since it's subject to discussion)	

2007-11-05 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp: Use agg::renderer_mclip instead
	of agg::renderer_base, since the latter supports multiple clipping
	boxes. This allows us to apply all the clipping regions at once. A
	performance gain should be expected for movies with multiple
	clipping regions.

2007-11-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: add more test for
	  TextField.variable (variable name). Variables can be in objects
	  (not necessarely in sprites). Also, we got triggering of updates
	  wrong.
	* configure.ac: make "missing KDE" message more didactic
	  (see bug #21497)
	* server/shape.{cpp,h}: drop the point_test method, not much useful
	  on its own ...

2007-11-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/shape.{cpp,h}: extract a ray_crossing out of point_test.
	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp (point_test): use 
	  path::ray_crossing against any filled path, to detect fills
	  composed by multiple paths. Fixes bug #21498.

2007-11-02 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: Add OSRenderMesa, a class
	implementing OSMesa's offscreen rendering system. Move
	ogl_accessible() to the render_handler_ogl class because it
	now needs access to members of that class. Remove the unused
	get_whole_shapes method. Implement getPixel and friends.
	Please note that this offscreen code is only enabled when
	OSMESA_TESTING is defined, which the build system currently
	does not yet do due to issues described in 
	http://gnashdev.org/?q=node/46 .
	* server/gnash.h: Add an optional boolean argument to
	create_render_handler_ogl, which specifies whether the
	factory should immediately run OpenGL initialization code.
	This code should not be run immediately in the OSMesa case,
	since OpenGL calls should not be made until a context is
	available, which is not the case until initTestBuffer is
	called. initTestBuffer, in turn, cannot be called until
	renderer instantiation.
	* testsuite/MovieTester.cpp: Add support for OpenGL renderer
	testing.

2007-11-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gui.cpp (getMovieInfo): add info about the current active
	  mouse entity.

2007-11-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Color.cpp: more bug fixes.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Color.as: more tests. Most pass
	  except a suspicious one about some kind of rounding which is
	  not clear to me.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: two more tests pass.

2007-11-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Global.cpp: don't forget to initialize the Color class.
	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: add a _userCxform and accessor 
	  methods; override get_world_cxform to take it into account.
	* server/asobj/Color.cpp: implement {get,set}Transform and
	  {get,set}RGB. Not 100% correct, but good progress on
	  halloweenpaint.swf (see bug #21498)
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Color.as: test {get,set}Transform and
	  {get,set}RGB.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: couple of color-related tests now succeed,
	  more still fail.

2007-11-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/drag_state.h: add x/y offset members.
	* server/movie_root.cpp (set_drag_state, doMouseDrag):
	  implement relative dragging. Fixes bug #21496.

2007-11-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Player.cpp (run): make the window at least 1x1 pixels sized
	  in a collapsed SWF header situation.

2007-11-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.{cpp,h}: remove the do_mouse_drag
	  method. It's silly to call it for each sprite or button
	  when at the end only a single character (if any) would
	  do something useful with that.
	* server/: button_character_instance.cpp, sprite_instance.cpp:
	  remove the do_mouse_drag call from the (advance) function.
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: Move the doMouseDrag method
	  here, as a private one, called from advance. Also, drag
	  anyway, even if not correctly, when the drag is not
	  lock-centered (to be fixed later).

2007-11-01 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler.h: Document that draw_poly draws a
	thin border specified by the outline parameter.
	* backend/render_handler_ogl.{cpp,h}: Header/impl separation
	for class bitmap_info_ogl.

2007-11-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/GnashException.h: Add ActionTypeError exception.
	* server/as_value.{cpp,h} (to_primitive): a closer to ECMA-262
	  [[ToPrimitive]] implementation.
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp: update use of as_value::to_primitive.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: two successes.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: some more successes.
	* server/vm/fn_call.h (dump_args): print debug string version
	  for each argument.

2007-11-01 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_cairo.cpp: Implement draw_poly.
	
2007-11-01 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler.h: Document that renderers should
	ignore subshapes in glyphs, as demonstrated by Agg and
	evidenced in text-test.swf.
	* backend/render_handler_{cairo,ogl}.cpp: draw_glyph: call
	draw_subshape directly with all paths, since subshapes should
	be ignored.

2007-10-31 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_ogl.h: New header file; the beginnings
	of header/implementaion separation.
	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: New OpenGL renderer
	implementation. In this initial version, support for subshapes
	and poor man's anti-aliasing (only filled shapes are affected)
	are added. The new renderer will facilitate the addition of
	more good stuff, like real anti-aliasing and to eliminate the
	many remaining OpenGL bugs. Simple masking now works.
	* gui/gtk_glue_cairo.cpp: Use a RGBA buffer by default.
	* gui/gtk_glue_gtkglext.cpp: Enable the stencil buffer rather
	than the depth buffer, since the former is used while the
	latter is not.

2007-10-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: add test for
	  toString/valueOf properties (un)availability.
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (ActionNewAdd): don't assume
	  stack element references are valid after calls to to_primitive.
	  Fixes bug #21482.

2007-10-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* lots of files: assert(0) -> abort()

2007-10-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: add a test which
	  seems to be killing gnash (segfault).

2007-10-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.cpp (to_debug_string): assert(0) => abort()
	  [ to abort when NDEBUG is defined ]
	* server/character.h (markCharacterReachable): mark mask as
	  reachable.

2007-10-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Player.cpp (run): don't give up if the movie has collapsed size.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp: 
	  Check rendering effects of the setMask call.

2007-10-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTestRunner.cpp:
	  Check hitdetector bounds and reactions on mouse movement
	* gui/gui.{cpp,h}: Add support for mouse pointer movements using the
	  keyboard arrow keys. Support is currently enabled but can be
	  switched off at compile time. If compile-time enabled support can
	  still be toggled at runtime, currently defaults to enabled and 
	  menu items to toggle it are missing.

2007-10-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.cpp (display): don't render dynamic masks.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/masks_testrunner.cpp: no more failures here.

2007-10-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/masks_testrunner.cpp: add tests for effects

	  to execute. Fixes bug #21465.

2007-10-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.h (setMask): set character as invalidated
	  when it's mask change. Needs more care: when the mask itself
	  changes, we should find a way to invalidate the maskee as well,
	  but we currently have no refefence from the mask to the maskee.
	* server/dlist.cpp (display): add support for dynamic masks.
	  Needs more care: test what happens with nested masks, check if
	  it is possible to trigger infinite recursions.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (sprite_setMask); draft support for
	  setMask. Needs more care: forbid a character to mask itself,
	  see care needed in dlist to avoid infinite recursion (A masks B
	  contining B2 maksing A)
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DrawingApiTest.as: turn user-defined cursor
	  into a mask or disable the mask on click (toggle). Needs testing
	  in the runner.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/masks_test.c: add comments.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/masks_testrunner.cpp: add section testing
	  for setMask effects on rendering. Needs more care: add test for

	  URLAccessManager.h must be included.
	* server/as_object.h,.cpp: Make instanceOf a recursive function
	  so that non-proper properties, like interfaces, will be correctly
	  searched. Add get_super() and get_constructor() functions, not yet
	  implemented.
	* server/namedStrings.h,.cpp: Add another anonymous string.
	* server/asobj/ClassHierarchy.cpp: Add prototypes to loaded objects if
	  they don't do so themselves.
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp: ImplementsOp -- not quite working, yet.
	* server/vm/Machine.h,.cpp: More work toward AS3 ability.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Date.as: Fix bogus test -- the time
	  returned depends on local timezone, so you can't check to the second.
	* server/vm/SafeStack.h, server/vm/CodeStream.h -- Comment updates.

2007-10-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/MovieTester.cpp (checkPixel): multiply tolerance by

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/masks_testrunner.cpp: fix color values,
	  which reveals all tests pass (need to add tests for setMask next).
	* server/character.h: add setMask, getMask, isDynamiMask,
	  rename isMask to isMaskLayer, add change isMask to check both
	  dynamic and static masks.
	* server/dlist.cpp: replace isMask with isMaskLayer

	* server/as_object.{cpp,h} (findUpdatableProperty): return
	  static properties in inheritance chain if found, as correctly
	  documented in the header file (need an ABC compiler for real 
	  testing).

2007-10-27 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* various Makefile.am: Remove libgnashbackend, since it is
	unused and OS X's `ar' chokes on the empty archive we
	currently create.
	* gui/Makefile.am: Don't put the gnash script in the Carbon
	bundle; instead, put bin_PROGRAMS in it.
	* gui/aqua.cpp: Implement the event loop necessary to draw
	the renderer.
	* gui/aqua_glue.h: Pass a window pointer to the rendering glue
	so the glue can attach the renderer to the window.
	* gui/aqua_ogl_glue.{cpp,h}: Implement the aqua GUI by setting
	up an OpenGL context.
	* gui/gui.h: Add a default implementation for setInterval since
	it is the same for most renderers.

2007-10-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: add new successes
	  from updated swfdec snapshot.

	  instead of 'delete(a.b)' -- the latter wasn't supported
	  by erlier Ming versions.

2007-10-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Global.as: more tests about invisible
	  flags over inherited getter-setters (most failures are for SWF6
	  only)

2007-10-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.cpp (findUpdatableProperty): don't overlook
	  invisible properties in *this* object, it'll be eventually
	  overridden.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Global.as: more successes.

2007-10-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.cpp: have __proto__ respect the same
	  visibility rules of other properties, check visibility
	  rules in findUpdatableProperty.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: one more test passing (more failing
	  from the same set).

2007-10-26 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* server/parser/video_stream_def.cpp: Check if iterator is valid, before

	* libmedia/FLVParser.h, libmedia/MediaParser.h: Move the videoFrameType
	  definition from FLVParser.h to MediaParser.h.
	* libmedia/VideoDecoder.h, libmedia/gst/VideoDecoder{Gst,ffmpeg}.{h,cpp}:
	  Make decodeToImage return a auto_ptr (again).
	* server/video_stream_instance.cpp: We now receive the decoded image in a
	  auto_ptr.
	* server/parser/video_stream_def.{h,cpp}: Changed decoding of embedded video
	  to be on-demand, instead of at-parse. If asked to decode a random frame, we
	  rewind to the lastest keyframe (or the last decoded frame) and decode all
	  the frames needed to produce the requested frame.

2007-10-26 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* configure.ac: Added quotation-marks around $extensions_list.

2007-10-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/targetPath.as: add a failing test
	  as borrowed from swfdec
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: test _parent is not
	  a proper property (gnash fails)

	  getvariable/setvariable.

2007-10-25 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

2007-10-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: new swfdec tests passing

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/opcode_guard_test2.sc: add more consistency
	  checks for zou new tests.
	* server/as_environment.cpp (find_target): always use current, not
	  original target.
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.{cpp,h} (CommonSetTarget): reset target as first
	  thing, so that find_target won't use previously current target
	  to resolve relative paths.

2007-10-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: more setTarget tests (failing)

2007-10-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_environment.cpp (find_target): use original target
	  for relative paths.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: succeed in settarget-relative-*.swf

2007-10-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (CommonSetTarget):
	  Reset to original target if argument doesn't correspond

2007-10-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Object.cpp: don't replicate all exported interfaces
	  to the Object class; move registerClass from prototype to class;
	  have hasOwnProperty return false on invalid calls.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Object.as: one more success, more

2007-10-24 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg_style.h: don't force premultiply()
	  for RGBA bitmaps, fixes bug #20972 (hopefully...)  

2007-10-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: new succeeding tests from swfdec
	  testsuite. Note that prototype-recursion-* tests prevent
	  the full testsuite from being run as gnash goes into an infinite
	  recursion failling to detect max call stack limit (our
	  getter/setters use a brand new as_environment, and thus stack
	  everytime they are invoked).

2007-10-24 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* extensions/fileio/fileio.cpp: Fixed a bug in fgets() which
	  caused a segfault on empty files

	  intersections between SnappingRanges
	* server/dlist.cpp: optimize add_invalidated_bounds() for
	  masks (don't invalidate outside of masks)

	  rules when drawing a mask (unlike normal shapes); some cleanup
	* gui/fb.cpp: Limit pointing device events reading loop

2007-10-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

2007-10-23 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Object.as: more failures about 
	  setting members which has a  normal property in the inheritance
	  chain but a getter-setter higher in the chain.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: more failures !
	* macros/sdl.m4: cleanups
	* configure.ac: use test, not the ``['' command, in m4 macros.
	* server/URLAccessManager.cpp (allow): fix assertion checking.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/ming_utils.h: provide a CALLFRAME
	  macro to use the syntax recognized by the detected Ming
	  version.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/: frame_label_test.c, path_format_test.c:
	  use CALLFRAME instead of callFrame.

2007-10-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: Print out a warning for missing boost libraries
	that are only recommended, and not required.
	* macros/boost.m4: Look for some libraries that are only needed
	for testing, but still flag the user if they aren't found.

2007-10-22 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/asobj/Stage.cpp: corrected Stage.width and Stage.height, 
	  fixes bug #21364  

2007-10-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* configure.ac: fix docmentation for --enable-cygnal

	  read all input and call onData, providing a default one.
	  Still misses a background thread, but is a bit more correct
	  now, in that allows overriding onData.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/XML.as: succeeds in finding
	  onData in XML.prototype.

2007-10-20 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/Makefile.am: fix MEDIADIR path (for gnashrc)
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Makefile.am: use testsuite/gnashrc
	  for running tests (so loads from MEDIADIR are allowed).

2007-10-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/video_stream_def.{cpp,h}: split read into
	  readDefineVideoStream and readDefineVideoFrame, make
	  presence of a non-null _decoder member a sign of a

	  text field.

2007-10-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/: movie_root.{cpp,h}, edit_text_character.cpp:
	  Renamed movie_root::{get,set}_active_entity to
	  movie_root::{get,set}Focus for clarity, and documented it.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: we now pass
	  addProperty-get-prototypes-{6,7,8}.swf

2007-10-18 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* testsuite/MovieTester.cpp: Conditionally include cairo header.

2007-10-18 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/Makefile.am -- Remove GetterSetter files, add Property.cpp
	* server/Property.h -- Combine all 3 types (ordinary, getter/setter,
	  destructive getter/setter) into a single class, Property, using boost::
	  variant. Remove all virtual functions. Add key and namespace.
	* server/PropertyList.h,.cpp -- Change container to a multi-index storing
	  properties by value rather than by pointer, add functions for retrieval
	  by order number (for AS3). Remove all virtual functions.
	* server/array.cpp,.h -- Change get_member signature to match the one in
	  as_object which now includes a namespace.
	* server/asClass.cpp -- Change asMethod and asClass to use an as_object
	  backend
	* server/asClass.h -- Move asName out. Change asMethod and asClass to new
	  signatures.
	* server/as_function.cpp -- Add checks for prototype.
	* server/as_object.cpp -- Chnage to new PropertyList style, some early
	  code for interfaces (ImplementsOp) which should be working soon.

	* server/as_environment.{cpp,h}: have find_object_{dot,slash}syntax
	  support a scope stack.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: fix last failing test. Should be
	  easy to add more failing (hint: get variable in one-before-last member
	  of with stack scope).

2007-10-15 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp, backend/render_handler_agg.h, gui/fb.cpp,
	  gui/fltk_glue_agg.cpp, gui/gtk_glue_agg.cpp, gui/kde_glue_agg.cpp,
	  gui/riscos_glue_agg.cpp, gui/sdl_agg_glue.cpp: Don't let the renderer
	  choose the rowstride (bytes per line) as this depends on the GUI
	  and use the rowstride reported by the MIT-SHM extension instead of
	  calculating it.
	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp: Code cleanup

2007-10-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/fb.cpp: update use of agg_detect_pixel_format

	  because we didn't support the fscommand:quit command.

2007-10-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/check.h: force literal string to std::string conversion in
	  check_equals and xcheck_equals (fixes compiler warnings from gcc >=
	  4.1.x)
	* server/as_environment.cpp (get_variable_raw, set_variable_raw): don't
	  explicitly look in locals for SWF6 and higher, as locals should already
	  be in the scope chain; look in scope chain *before* locals in the
	  SWF5- case (only 'with stack' in that case).
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: fixed a couple of tests about locals
	  and 'with' stack seek order.

2007-10-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_environment.cpp (get_variable_raw): reduce calls to
	  string_table::find.

	lirc.m4, ming.m4, mysql.m4, opengl.m4, pango.m4, pthreads.m4,
	sdl.m4, x11.m4: Also test for /usr/lib64, so it doesn't sneak into
	our LDFLAGS. This will cause make distcheck to fail on a 64 bit machine.
	
2007-10-13 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* gui/fbsup.h: Make PS/2 mouse the default (instead of ETurboTouch)

2007-10-12 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	  searching the target.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: test that target don't need to be
	  stacked in nesting setTarget context.

2007-10-10 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-mtasc.all/: Base1.as, Derived1.as, super_test1.as,
	  Makefile.am: test for super, detected an unexpected 'ActionLimit hit'

	* testsuite/misc-mtasc.all/function.as, Makefile.am: rename function.as to 
	  function_test.as, fix a name conflict in a case insensitive file system. There

	* server/vm/SafeStack.h: Remove limit on size of grow()
	* server/vm/Machine.cpp: Name changed from server/vm/AbcHandlers.cpp,

	  the same as the last key pressed.

2007-10-08 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libmedia/AudioDecoderSimple.cpp: Fix stereo/mono resampling.
	* libmedia/sdl/AudioDecoderMad.cpp: Fix compilation and stereo/mono
	  resampling.

2007-10-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/loop_test9.c: add a test for RemoveObject
	  having effect for out-of-static-zone depths (now the test would
	  segfault with a gnash version prior the fix for bug #21281 - 0.8.1
	  for instance). Head is fine.

2007-10-08 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/vm/AbcHandlers.cpp: More work on the AS3 interpreter --
	  function calls and such.
	* server/vm/Machine.h: Remove Stack (moved to SafeStack.h), remove

2007-10-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/ming_utils.c: have totals() and friend also
	  print a final line containing grand totals. This will be easier
	  to use for consistency checking from the generic-testrunner.sh.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/: Makefile.am, loop_test9.c: test that
	  a PlaceObject-placed instance in a depth higher then 0 (after
	  depth-shift) doesn't get removed on jump-back. Verifies behaviour
	  of bug #21281.

2007-10-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/RemoveObjectTag.cpp (loader): don't attempt to unregister
	  a timeline depth if depth is out of the static zone. PlaceObject2
	  does the same avoiding to register the depth in this case. Fixes bug
	  #21281.
	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.cpp (dump_tag_bytes): output cleanup.

2007-10-07 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

2007-10-07 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/vm/CodeStream.h: New file. Complete definition of a stream
	  for safely reading code, with necessary reader functions for AS3.

2007-10-06 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* libmedia/sdl/VideoDecoderFfmpeg.cpp (decode): check return from
	  avcodec_alloc_frame.

	  (printf formats)

2007-10-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.{cpp,h}: add init_member and init_property
	  based on string_table::key

	  documentation to mention string matching is always case-insensitive.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: export-case-# success.

2007-10-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Number.as: test conversion of a string
	  with a decimal point to a number (fails when locales have comma
	  instead of dot as the decimal point). See bug #21168.

2007-10-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/string.{h,cpp} (init_string_instance): when in SWF6 fetch
	  constructor from the global object, to use any overrided one
	  (swfdec testsuite contains a test for this).
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (ActionGetMember): drop special handling
	  for 'length' (it's incorrect and was marked with a FIXME).
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: string-convert-{6,7} succeed now.

2007-10-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/string.cpp (string_index_of): only use second argument
	  if it casts to positive integer.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/String.as: more tests.

2007-10-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_function.cpp (function_call): handle the case in which
	  first argument given to Function.call does not cast to an object.
	  The handling is not correct, but at least prevents assertion
	  failures and prints an ascoding error. Fixes bug #21236.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Function.as: add few more tests for
	  Function.call(<not-an-object>).

2007-10-05  Rob Savoye  <rob@ripple.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/boost.m4: Adjust error messages when boost files aren't
	found by configure.
	* configure.ac: Adjust error messages when boost files aren't
	found by configure.

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/String.as: couple more tests for
	  String.indexOf (lots more needed!).
	* server/asobj/AsBroadcaster.{cpp,h} (initialize): query
	  addListener and removeListener methods from the global
	  AsBroadcaster, using any overridden member (shown
	  to be needed by swfdec testsuite).
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/AsBroadcaster.as: the new tests
	  are fixed, added a TODO for adding more.

2007-10-05 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* gui/gui.cpp: Handle key releases again.

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* macros/boost.m4: Check for a directory without "boost" as an
	additional sub directory.

	* macros/boost.m4: Make the --with-options work correctly. Recode
	how all the directories, headers, and libraries get found, or
	configure fails to find any dependant file.

2007-10-06 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>
	* server/vm/Machine.h: More comments about functions, some
	  signature corrections.
	* server/vm/AbcHandlers.cpp: Definition of some of the necessary
	  support functions.

2007-10-06 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/vm/Machine.h: New File. First iteration (not documented,
	  not compilable) of class definition for VM for ActionScript3
	  blocks.
	* server/vm/AbcHandlers.cpp: More regularity, some small changes.

2007-10-05 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: Allow attachMovie() to accept also

	  Have the test end with an "END OF TEST" trace, and expect that.

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/generic-testrunner.sh: add support for consistency
	  checking (-c and -C switches)
	* testsuite/misc-swfmill.all/Makefile.am: expect jump_after_end.swf
	  to end with a PASSED trace (for now this will catch errors in
	  jump after end bugs).

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfmill.all/jump_after_end.xml: Made the
	  self-contained (almost completely). The problem now is that
	  if it fails it will NOT print nor FAILED nor PASSED so
	  we'll need the test *runner* to implement some sort of
	  consistency check to verify the end of test is reached.
	  We should do this always, btw...

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfmill.all/jump_after_end.xml:
	  Fixed the XML to *really* do what I intended it to
	  do. Still not self-contained though.

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfmill.all/: Makefile.am, jump_after_end.xml:
	  Test that it is completely fine to jump past the END opcode
	  in an action buffer (thanks Chad). Note that the tests in
	  misc-swfmill.all are not automated yet (need to find out how
	  to make use of the Dejagnu.swf lib)

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.cpp: catch less ActionLimitException: in
	  setMovieRoot and in advance (both can trigger immediate execution
	  of actions). Basically I removed from setLevel as it can be called
	  by a child of processAction thus resulting in a missing cleanup.

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.cpp: catch more ActionLimitException: in
	  setLevel and in advance (both can trigger immediate execution
	  of actions).

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (ActionSetRegister, ActionPushData):
	  Don't use global registers in a function2 context with local
	  registers.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: success for register-count.swf and
	  definefunction2-registers-#.swf

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (CommonGetUrl): case-insensitive
	  'fscommand' matching. 

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/action_buffer.{h,cpp}: add readFullTag method not
	  bothering to check for an END opcode thus making read faster.
	* server/swf/DoActionTag.h (read): use action_buffer::readFullTag.

2007-10-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/action_buffer.cpp (read): don't give up if an END
	  opcode is not found. You can find real-world cases for a missing
	  END in swfdec testsuite, tipically generated by swfmill.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: 2 more successes.

2007-10-04 Aleksey Lim <alsroot@member.fsf.org>

	* libmedia/MediaParser.h: wrap avcodec.h include in extern "C"
	  namespace.

2007-10-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.{cpp,h}: use a new SpriteProxy class for 
	  doing all the soft-reference things. This will now be a flavor
	  of the boost::variant. Advantage of this is we won't keep alive
	  destroyed sprites only because we need their original path for
	  rebinding.

2007-10-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* autogen.sh: reccommend installing libltdl3-dev when libtoolize
	  fails.

2007-10-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.cpp (to_sprite, to_debug_string): use isDestroyed()
	  instead of isUnloaded() to trigger "dangliness" of a soft reference.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: the two new tests about
	  soft references succeed now.

2007-10-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.{cpp,h}: remove unused functions, call destroy()
	  on characters whos unload() returned false.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (dtor): remove useless call to
	  DisplayList::clear()

2007-10-04 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libbase/BitsReader.h: Added doc.
	* libmedia/AudioDecoderSimple.cpp: Another impovement of ADPCM decoding.

2007-10-04 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/vm/AbcHandlers.cpp: More work on the main interpreter for AS3.

2007-10-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.{cpp,h}: add destroy() and isDestroyed()
	  members. Will surely help with soft references and hopefully
	  with opcode guarding too.
	* server/movie_root.cpp (cleanupDisplayList): call destroy()
	  on unloaded but still not destroyed characters.
	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: override destroy() to remove
	  properties.

2007-10-04 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libmedia/gst/gstappsink.{c,h}: Updated to match latest gstreamer cvs.
	* libmedia/*: Fix cvs is tags.

2007-10-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: add test showing
	  that it's NOT *unload* of sprite triggering soft-references
	  rebinding but rather *destroy* of them !

2007-10-03 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libbase/Makefile.am: Added BitsReader.{h,cpp}
	* server/Makefile.am: Removed BitsReader.{h,cpp}
	* server/BitsReader.{h,cpp}: moved to libbase, and added got_bits().
	* libmedia/AudioDecoderSimple.cpp: Use BitsReader in libbase.
	  Fixed (at least some) adpcm decoding bugs (bug #21177).
	* libmedia/sdl/AudioDecoderFfmpeg.cpp: fix cvs id tag.
	* libmedia/sdl/sound_handler_sdl.cpp: Only stop playback of sound if
	  completely done. If nothing has been decoded assume nothing can be
	  decoded, fixes bug #21219.
	* libmedia/sdl/sound_handler_sdl.h: Only delete decoder if it exists.

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.{cpp,h}: use boost::variant instead of the union.
	  Idea taken from patch #6067. No clever templates used, this is just
	  the basic thing, can be improved in the future. Main reason to have
	  done so is for being able to drop the reference to the original
	  sprite for soft references (still not implemented but now possible).
	* libbase/smart_ptr.h: define intrusive_ptr_{add,drop}_ref for
	  as_object needed for the "clever" boost::get visitor of
	  boost::variant ...

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* cygnal/ACT/Makefile.am: don't list subdirs for which no
	  Makefile.am is present. TODO: add a Makefile.am there !

2007-10-04 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* libbase/rc.{cpp,h}: make expandPath void and other small cleanups.

2007-10-04 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/vm/AbcHandlers.cpp: New file. This will become the
	  interpreter for AS3, and I hope to convert the ASHandlers class
	  to this style as well, as it offers some significant clarity
	  and performance gainst.  At the moment, this code won't
	  compile, isn't complete, and isn't even consistent.

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.cpp (to_bool*): assert that OBJECT and FUNCTION
	  values are never null.

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.{cpp,h}: stop using m_string_value as a cache
	  for convertion to string (propedeutic for storing the string
	  into the union). clean m_string_value inside drop_refs
	  (should reduce memory use).

2007-10-03 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* libbase/rc.{cpp,h}: reference instead of copy for expandpath
	* testsuite/libbase/TCXXRc.cpp, gnashrc.in: tests for insecureSSL
	* docs: add insecureSSL and minor cleanups to gnashrc.xml
	* gui/gnash.cpp, gui/gtk.cpp: comment out broken / disabled movie
	  controls until they work.

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.{cpp,h}: changed to_string and to_string_versioned
	  methods to return by value rather then by const ref. Next step will
	  be only using a string member when needed.

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: Test effects of unload
	  on clip bounds (confirms we should clean the drawable on unload).

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as:
	  more extensive tests for soft references, confirming current
	  gnash behaviour being unbreaked.

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: more tests for ActionShiftRight
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp (ActionShiftRight): fix new testcases
	  (and the current 3dtris.swf problem with it - see bug #21074).

2007-10-03 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp: Drop top of stack in ActionStringCompare,
	  since there are two stack elements on entry and (should be) one
	  on exit.

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (unload): clear the drawable when unload
	  (won't be needed anymore).
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: add support for debugging the drawing
	  API.

2007-10-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/shape_character_def.{cpp,h}: add numEdges and numPaths
	  methods.

2007-10-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gui.cpp (restart): call movie_root::reset so scripts are enabled
	  again; (getMovieInfo): add info about wheter scripts are disabled.
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: add disableScripts and scriptsDisabled
	  methods; don't process queued actions if scripts are disabled,
	  disable scripts if ActionLimitException is thrown by execution of
	  an executable code.
	* server/vm/ActionExec.{cpp,h}: re-throw ActionLimitException so all
	  elements of the call stack have a chance to cleanup and the exception
	  is eventually cought by the movie_root.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: success with script abortion tests.

2007-10-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/xml.{cpp,h}: get environment passed for events
	  invocation purposes.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/: XML.as, XMLNode.as: use check.as
	  instead of dejagnu.as, add check_totals.
	* server/array.cpp (as_value_custom call operator): use the
	  environment passed to us, not a newly created one.

2007-10-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.cpp (callMethod): fix order in which
	  args are pushed on the stack [the version taking 2 args].
	* server/asobj/MovieClipLoader.cpp: initialize MovieClipLoader
	  instances as AsBroadcasters, call broadcastMessage for broadcasting,
	  use the environment used in the loadClip call.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClipLoader.as: add test for
	  existence of the broadcastMessage function.

2007-10-02 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.cpp (testInvariant): non-emptiness of _movies
	  container is NOT an invariant...

2007-10-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: remove the error-prone ::restart method.
	* testsuite/MovieTester.{cpp,h}: implement proper restart method.

2007-10-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: add a clear() method for clearing
	  everything managed by the movie_root/stage. Intended to be called
	  right before a brand new setRootMovie call (for restart).
	* gui/gui.cpp (menu_restart): get a real restart, including flash
	  variables settings and sure about the real initial movie_definition
	  that started everything.

2007-10-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gui.{cpp,h}: add movie_definition and movie_root members,
	  add _started member to postpone kick-start (movie_root::setRootMovie
	  call) in case we started in "stop" mode [ fixed bug #21212 ].
	  Avoid notifying mouse and key events to the core lib if in stop
	  mode.
	* gui/Player.{cpp,h}: update use of the Gui class.

2007-10-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp: cleanups in opcode guard code.

2007-10-01 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* libbase/curl_adapter.cpp: use curl_multi_info_read to get
	  better information about stream connections. Pass on CURL errors
	  if transaction fails (e.g. for self-certified SSL sites like Savannah).
	  Log HTTP code of all transactions. 400 and above logged as error.

2007-09-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/Makefile.am, libmedia/Makefile.am: remove no-dependencies
	  option. The option is still in libltdl/Makefile.am, dunno if it
	  makes sense there either.

2007-09-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/: Makefile.am,
	  action_execution_order_test8.c: build the test in SWF5 and SWF6 
	  version, to verify opcode guard being is not dependent on version
	  (well, at least not on those two versions, SWF5 including
	  curveball.swf).

2007-09-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/opcode_guard_test2.sc: test that unloaded
	  but still not removed current target is still used for finding
	  variables.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/Dejagnu.sc (xtotals): call xpass on
	  unexpected success.

2007-09-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libmedia/: MediaParser.h, VideoDecoder.h, AudoDecoder.h:
	  virtual classes need virtual destructors, or destructors of
	  subclasses will not be invoked be deleting instances by
	  base class pointer !

2007-09-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/opcode_guard_test.c: add xtotals() call.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/dejagnu_so_init.as: set and invoke
	  utility functions from/to _root. Fixes some scope chain problems
	  we have in Gnash, better tested in a more focused testcase.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: total runs check succeed
	  with the change above.

2007-09-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/check.as: rename totals_check,
	  xtotals_check to check_totals() and xcheck_totals (easier
	  to grep for 'xcheck').
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: update calls to check_totals()
	  and xcheck_totals()
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/ming_utils.c (Dejagnu.xtotals): call xpass
	  un unexpectedd success.

2007-09-30 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* libbase/curl_adapter.cpp: allow, with security warning, override
	  of curl's SSL certificate verification when requested in gnashrc.
	  Equivalent to curl --insecure.
	* libbase/rc.{cpp,h}: 'set insecureSSL on' disables SSL certificate
	  verification, thus allowing connections from the standalone player
	  to https:// sites when the certificate is invalid or untrusted.

2007-09-30 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>
	
	* server/environment.{h, cpp}: get_variable_raw() set 'this' to the orignial target
	  instead of the current one.
	* server/vm/ActionExec.{h, cpp}: getThisPointer() returns the original target for
	  golbal code. 
	* testsuite/actionsrcipt.all/with.as: xchecks to checks(fix 'this' context)
	  
2007-09-30 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test3.sc: '_root' is always
	  defined as tests shows.
	  
2007-09-30 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* libbase/tu_file.cpp: __SGI_LIBC_USING_FROM_STD(va_list).
	* libbase/Makefile.am: Don't include OPENGL_INCL, it might direct you
	  /usr/include on some systems and it doesn't seem necessary...
	* libmedia/Makefile.am: Added libltdl-stuff from libbase/Makefile.am.

2007-09-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/: check.as, with.as: use totals_check
	  and xtotals_check for macros, to avoid confusions.
	  Will come back on this on monday...

2007-09-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/: AsBroadcaster.as, Boolean.as,
	  Camera.as, Color.as, ContextMenu.as, CustomActions.as, Date.as,
	  Error.as, Function.as, Global.as, Inheritance.as, Key.as,
	  LoadVars.as, LocalConnection.as, Math.as, Microphone.as, Mouse.as,
	  MovieClip.as, MovieClipLoader.as, NetConnection.as, NetStream.as,
	  Number.as, Object.as, Selection.as, SharedObject.as, Stage.as,
	  String.as, System.as, TextField.as, TextSnapshot.as, Video.as,
	  XML.as, XMLNode.as, XMLSocket.as, array.as, case.as,
	  delete.as, enumerate.as, getvariable.as, ops.as, rtmp.as,
	  swap.as, targetPath.as, toString_valueOf.as:
	  Add a totals() call.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/check.as: add totals and xtotals macros.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: add totals(x) and xtotal(x)
	  calls
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/dejagnu_so_fini.as: remove the totals()
	  call.

2007-09-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/ming_utils.c (Dejagnu class): 
	  add totals(n, msg)  and xtotals(n, msg) to check number
	  of tests being run.

2007-09-29 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* docs: update Mozilla plugin install information to reflect current
	  state. Task #7340 contains ideas for improving installation.

2007-09-29 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* New: server/asClass.h,.cpp: Several different classes which work
	  together to construct a type library for ActionScript 3.  Work is
	  in progress to make this glean the same information from the current
	  ActionScript 2 information (through the Global object, as well
	  as hand coding) so that the 'implements' op can be written and so
	  that various AS2 things will work better.  This is not yet complete.
	  Because this code is in flux (though currently not broken), it is
	  not yet extensively commented.
	* server/Makefile.am: Add new files
	* server/namedStrings.h,.cpp: New strings for the AS3 namespaces.
	* server/parser/Namespace.h: Add resource marking -- this file is
	  going to be obsolete as soon as dependencies are verified.
	* server/parser/abc_block.h,.cpp: Update to be more modular, and to
	  build a type library from AS3 tag.
	* server/vm/VM.cpp: Change to registration method for new types.
	* New: Various .cvsignore files

2007-09-29 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/: Dejagnu.sc, check.sc,
	  opcode_guard_test2.sc: add and use xtotals.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: more tests for
	  TextField, toString and comparison..

2007-09-29 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/with.as: more tests for setTarget and found
	  the Dejagnu clip functions might be out of scope chain, and explicitly
	  targeting also not work.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/opcode_guard_test2.sc, Makefile.am : test opcode 
	  guard with setTarget. seems too much actions get discarded than expected.
	  
2007-09-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/rc.cpp: use fprintf rather then log_XXX during parsing.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: more tests,
	  check->check_equals.

2007-09-28 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* libbase/rc.{h,cpp}: move list parsing into a function; enable
	  'set <list> off' for disabling previously parsed lists. Add
	  error message when colons found in a list.
	* testsuite/libbase/TCXXRc.cpp, gnashrc-local.in: add test for
	  whitelist override.
	* docs: update user manual.

2007-09-28 Bernhard Rosenkraenzer <bero@arklinux.org>

	* configure.ac: rework SIZET_FMT detection to stop at first
	  success. See bug #21182.

2007-09-28 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libmedia/Makefile.am: Compile gstgnashsrc.{c,h} when gstreamer
	  is the mediahandler.

2007-09-28 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libmedia/AudioDecoder.h, libmedia/AudioDecoderNellymoser.{cpp,h},
	  libmedia/AudioDecoderSimple.h, libmedia/MediaBuffer.h, 
	  libmedia/MediaDecoder.h, libmedia/MediaParser.h libmedia/VideoDecoder.h,
	  libmedia/gst/VideoDecoderGst.h, libmedia/gst/gstappbuffer.{c,h},
	  libmedia/gst/gstappsink.{c,h}, libmedia/gst/gstappsrc.{c,h},
	  libmedia/gst/sound_handler_gst.h, libmedia/sdl/AudioDecoderFfmpeg.{cpp,h},
	  libmedia/sdl/AudioDecoderMad.{h,cpp}, libmedia/sdl/MediaDecoderSdl.{h,cpp},
	  libmedia/sdl/MediaParserFfmpeg.{h,cpp}, libmedia/sdl/sound_handler_sdl.h,
	  libmedia/sdl/VideoDecoderFfmpeg.h: Update docs.
	* libmedia/sdl/VideoDecoderFfmpeg.cpp: Fix memleak. Fixes bug #21180.
	* libmedia/sdl/sound_handler_sdl.cpp: Use the internal ADPCM decoder.

2007-09-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_function.{cpp,h}: Add a constructor
	  taking no args to use when a default prototype (iface)
	  is wanted. The other constructor, taking an interface
	  will be used when willing to control wheter or not a
	  prototype should be used (TextField don't have one in SWF5
	  and lower).
	* server/builtin_function.h: Same as with as_function, have
	  a constructor taking on interface for a default one, use
	  a NULL interface as meaning we don't want to expose a
	  prototype.
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: don't set a prototype for TextField
	  class in SWF5, make TextField instances of object when TextField
	  has no prototype.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: one more success.


2007-09-28 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* configure.ac, testsuite/libbase/TCXXRc.cpp, gnashrc-local.in: add
	  second rc file and test for append blacklist.
	* docs: update user manual with black- and whitelist information.

2007-09-28 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* libbase/rc.cpp: for whitelists and blacklists, 'set' overrides
	  lists from previous files, 'append' adds to previous files.
	* testsuite/libbase/gnashrc.in: update tests, replace colons (old
	  behaviour) with spaces (new behaviour) in lists. Please update
	  your own lists, as old behaviour must eventually disappear.

2007-09-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

 	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: few more tests
	  for TextField.toString.

2007-09-28  Rob Savoye  <rob@ripple.welcomehome.org>

	* gui/gtk.cpp: Add support for LIRC, if it's running. Add event
	handler for LIRC messages.

2007-09-28  Rob Savoye  <rob@ripple.welcomehome.org>

	* extensions/Makefile.am: Add dbus to DIST_SUBDIRS.
	
	* libbase/extension.cpp: Initialize the entry first so the loop
	actually works.
	* extensions/dbus_ext.h, dbus_ext.cpp: Minimal code stubs for a
	soon to be Dbus extension.
	* configure.ac: Add extensions/dbus. Drop calling
	GNASH_PATH_LIRC, as Gnash has it's own LIRC client code, and
	doesn't use the lirc_client API anymore.
	* macros/dbus.m4: New macro for Dbus support.
	* extensions/Makefile.am: Build dbus extension if requested.
	
2007-09-28 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libbase/Makefile.am, libmedia/sdl/VideoDecoderFfmpeg.h,
	  server/asobj/NetStreamFfmpeg.cpp: Fix building with libmedia.
	* libmedia/gst/VideoDecoderGst.{cpp,h}: Small comment update.

2007-09-28 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libmedia/, libmedia/sdl/, libmedia/gst/,
	  (in libmedia:) AudioDecoder.h, AudioDecoderSimple.{h,cpp}, Makefile.am,
	  AudioDecoderNellymoser.{h,cpp}, FLVParser.{h,cpp}, MediaDecoder.h, 
	  MediaParser.h, SoundInfo.h, MediaBuffer.h, VideoDecoder.h, sound_handler.h,

	  gstgnashsrc.{h.c}, gstappbuffer.{c,h}, gstappsink.{c,h}, gstappsrc.{c,h}:
	  Files added for the new libmedia (finally!!). Some og theese files are moved
	  from the backend/ and libbase/ folders (see below). Not all files are yet in use.
	* backend/sound_handler*, libbase/embedVideoDecoder*: Moved to libmedia.
	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, backend/Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am, 
	  server/Makefile.am, server/asobj/Makefile.am, server/parser/Makefile.am,

	  Use VideoDecoder instead of embedVideoDecoder.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: Don't decode and resample the ADPCM and raw audio
	  before passing to the soundhandler.
	  Read more about libmedia here: http://wiki.gnashdev.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

2007-09-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.{cpp,h}: drop the get_text_value override here.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/: toString_valueOf.as, MovieClip.as:
	  more successes.

2007-09-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: more
	  xcheck => xcheck_equals (easier to tell what's going on).
	
2007-09-28 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.h: add useCustomToString method to handle corner
	  cases for which an ActionScript class doesn't want to use toString
	  methods, when available, for converting to a string.
	* server/as_value.cpp (to_string): check with useCustomToString if
	  for an object value we should or not call the ActionScript toString
	  method.
	* server/asobj/string.cpp: override useCustomToString to return false
	  and act as dumb and complex as the proprietary player (urgh)
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: two tests fixed.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/get_frame_number_test.c: one test fixed.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: three tests fixed.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Global.as: test that parseInt() would
	  call a custom toString() function against first parameter, if an
	  object.

2007-09-27 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* gui/gtk{.cpp,sup.h}: Introduce addFDListener, which will make the
	GDK event loop poll the specified file descriptor and execute the
	specified callback if data is to be read from the file desciptor.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.cpp (setPropFlags): properly convert the properties
	  to lowercase for SWF < 7.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/String.as: successes in unprotecting
	  {String,Object}.prototype.toString from deletion.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/String.as: tests for toString and it's
	  deletion/unprotection from deletion (succeeds from SWF7 and higher,
	  fails up to SWF6)

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Global.as: add test for
	  parseInt(<stringObject>).
	* server/asobj/Global.cpp (as_global_parseint): fix
	  the parseInt(<stringObject>) case
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: xcheck =>
	  xcheck_equals

2007-09-27 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* gui/gnash.cpp: remove ESC = Quit from gnash --help output. It's not true
	  and would potentially interfere with movie key events if it were. Ctrl-B
	  commented out, because it also doesn't do anything.
	* gui/gtk.cpp: code cleanups, internationalization.

2007-09-27 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* docs/C/usage.xml, gui/gnash.cpp: add/update Ctrl-L
	* gui/gui.cpp: make keyboard shortcuts work for both upper and lower
	  case. Correct step back ('[') and forward (']'), which are documented to
	  need Ctrl and were the wrong way round. Function menu_step_forward
	  is correctly called, but apparently doesn't work.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/MovieTester.{cpp,h}: add restart() method.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/simple_loop_testrunner.cpp: fix expected
	  invalidated bounds: we expect it to be the WORLD range on start
	  and restart. Test ::restart itself.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: add the concept of an 'invalidated'
	  stage/movie_root. The Stage is only invalidated when the background
	  color changes, dunno if it should also be invalidated by changes
	  in the _levels.. maybe I'm using a confusing terminology here...
	  Anyway this fixes bug #21169 and probably allow for cleanups 
	  in the gui code, where some paranoia is used to tell the first
	  ::display call apart from subsequent, exactly for the invalidated
	  bounds on startup problem.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.cpp (restart): rework restart mechanism
	  by actually re-instantiating the root from it's definition.

2007-09-27 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* server/movie_root.cpp: move level0->restart()
	  to avoid assertion failure.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp (call operator): re-enable
	  opcode-guard but guard current target, not original
	  one. Keeps feed.swf and curveball.swf fixed and also
	  fixes the tests in our testsuite that where expected
	  to fail since disabling the opcode guard.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test8.c,
	  testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc,
	  testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test3.sc:
	  success in the opcode-guard tests.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (get_member): make "_global"
	  a property (althought non-proper) of MovieClip. Fixes failures
	  in MovieClip.as.

2007-09-27 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Movieclip.as, XML.as: fix a few unstable checks.
	  and a few more tests.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/action_buffer.cpp (disasm_instruction): neater output.
	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp: tweak action verbosity output.

2007-09-27 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.{cpp,h}: add dumpActions() debugging function
	  useful to tell which opcode are discarded due to opcode-guard.
	  (change #if 0 to #if 1 in the opcode-guard code to see).
	  For the curveball.swf case, the unloading opcode is a
	  GotoLabel("Serve"), followed by a Play and a SetTarget which are
	  discarded when opcode-guard is in effect.

2007-09-27 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/opcode_guard_test.c, Makefile.am: new testcase
	  for opcode guard.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/edittext_test1.sc: more tests, passed.
	  
2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (get_member): forget that
	  _root as undefined when unloaded thing. Broke other
	  tests in the testsuite.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test8.c,
	  testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc,
	  testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test3.sc:
	  Expect the 3 failures introduced by removal of opcode-level
	  unloaded guard. We know that 2 real-world movies are fixed
	  by removing that opcode-level guard, so we likely need 
	  more testing of this thing. 

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/: action_execution_order_test10.sc,
	  action_execution_order_test12.sc, edittext_test1.sc,
	  movieclip_destruction_test2.sc, movieclip_destruction_test3.sc,
	  movieclip_destruction_test4.sc, soft_reference_test1.sc:
	  Add expected number of tests run in the totals() call.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_environment.cpp (get_variable_raw): don't handle _root and
	  _levelX in any special way, they are just sprite members !
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (get_member): _root doesn't exist if
	  we're unloaded.
	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp (call operator): drop opcode-level
	  unloaded guard. Fixes bugs #21069 (feed.swf) and #20996
	  (curveball.swf) w/out reopening #20974 (sonic.swf). 
	  Changes in as_environment.cpp and sprite_instance.cpp above
	  do the rest for misc-ming and misc-swfc tests..

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/morph2_character_def.cpp (read):
	  Don't print malformed swf errors if number of paths in defining
	  shapes don't match: only edges matter.
	* gui/gtk.cpp (gdk_to_gnash_key): GDK_ooblique => GDK_oslash
	  (gtk-2.0 in debian stable doesn't define the former).
	* server/: BevelFilter.h, BlurFilter.h, ConvolutionFilter.h,
	  DropShadowFilter.h, GlowFilter.h, GradientBevelFilter.h,
	  GradientGlowFilter.h: include <boost/cstdint.hpp> for XintXX_t.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (define_sound_loader): don't delete
	  the sound data, ownership was transferred to the sound hanlder.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_value.cpp (equals): in SWF5, functions are
	  considered null types for what concerns equality.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/: Function.as,
	  Inheritance.as, Object.as, toString_valueOf.as: 
	  new successes.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_environment.cpp (dump_global_registers): better
	  presentation for global registers.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/PropertyList.{cpp,h}: add dump to map.
	* server/as_object.{cpp,h}: add dump_members to map.
	* server/as_environment.cpp: implement dumper for local
	  variables.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp (call operator): initialize maxBranchCount
	  once at start of function; include PC of last jump in maxBranchCount
	  exception.

2007-09-26 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* gui/gtk.cpp: More moving menu items about.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: add test for bitwise and between
	  negative and positive number.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/sound_handler.h (create_sound): document meaning of a NULL
	  data.
	* backend/sound_handler_gst.cpp (create_sound): don't choke on NULL
	  data.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (sound_stream_head_loader): mek the call
	  to create_sound() with NO data easier to read.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/sound_handler.h: add assign() and constructor taking
	  a memory buffer to the Buffer class.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/sound_handler.h (Buffer::reserve): don't try to copy
	  from the NULL pointer.

2007-09-26 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* gui/gtk.cpp,gtksup.h: add Refresh menu item, add gtk version checks
	  for some stock menu items, reorder and add stock images to Movie
	  Control menu.
	* gui/gui{cpp,h}: Force immediate redraw instead of waiting for next
	  frame.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/sound_handler.h: add more services to the
	  Buffer class (sounds like reinventing the std::vector class
	  actually).

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/sound_handler.h: define a Buffer class
	  to avoid duplicating code within the different
	  versions of sound_data and active_sound.
	* backend/sound_handler_gst.{cpp,h}: Use a Buffer
	  member in the sound_data.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/sound_handler.h: document fill_stream_data return value.
	* backend/sound_handler_gst.{cpp,h}: Make buffer member of sound_data
	  private, provide an ::append() function with optimized reallocs.
	  Makes ninja parsing much faster. Same should be done for ffmpeg...
	  See http://wiki.gnashdev.org/wiki/index.php/NinjaProfile.

2007-09-26 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* backend/: sound_handler.h, sound_handler_gst.{cpp,h},
	  sound_handler_sdl.{cpp,h}: changed fill_stream_data
	  interface to take ownership of the data array.
	  Data is still copied, but can now be optimized locally
	  in each sound hanlder.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (sound_stream_block_loader):
	  update use of fill_stream_data.

2007-09-26 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* gui/gtk.cpp: change Oslash to Ooblique - GDK_Oslash is evidently
	  not defined in all gtk-2.0 versions.

2007-09-26 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp: If the stack is empty, there was not
	  an exception. Check for an empty stack first to avoid reading a
	  non-existent value.

2007-09-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gui.{cpp,h}: port SKIP_RENDERING_IF_LATE to use WallClockTimer.

2007-09-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/sprite_definition.h (ensure_frame_loaded): don't
	  assume the target frame has always been loaded, as we might
	  have loaded less frames then advertised in header.
	* server/parser/sprite_definition.cpp (read): don't change 
	  total frame count if zero. We wan't to respect it for _totalframes
	  to return the correct value.
	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: don't assume m_current_frame is less
	  then frame count or even loaded frames, as we might have loaded NO
	  frames too; use a std::set rather then a vector of boolean to tell
	  wheter init actions for a given frame have been executed; check
	  frames loaded count when needed.
	* server/movie_instance.cpp (advance, stagePlacementCallback): drop
	  the frames loaded count check, it's now in sprite_instance.

2007-09-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* doc/C/usermanual/usage/gnashrc.xml: document StreamsTimeout
	  directive, remove duplicated line for StartStopped.
	* libbase/: Makefile.am, WallClockTimer.{h,cpp}:
	  New class for wall-clock timing. Interface borrowed
	  by boost::timer, but this one uses wall-clock and
	  talks milliseconds instead of seconds.
	* libbase/rc.{cpp,h}: add support for streamsTimeout
	  setting.
	* testsuite/libbase/: TCXXRc.cpp, gnashrc.in: test
	  streamsTimeout setting.
	* libbase/curl_adapter.cpp (fill_cache): implement
	  stream timeout.

2007-09-25 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* server/gnash.h: fix typo in key::codeMap.

2007-09-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp (set_member): handle attempts
	  to set _width and _height to non-finite or negative values.
	  Fixes assertion failures in playing
	  flvplayer-debug-lulutv-beta4.swf.

2007-09-25 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* gui/gtk.cpp: clean up properties dialogue.
	* gui/gui.{h,cpp}: add menu_refresh_view() and refresh_view() to gui
	  with shortcut Ctrl-L. Now forces full redraw of next frame, but
	  should in future force immediate redraw.
	* gui/gnash.cpp: add Ctrl-L to gnash -h.

2007-09-25 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* macros/boost.m4: Look for multi_index directory in boost include
	  directory. No library is needed, headers only.

2007-09-25 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/registerclass_test3.sc:
	  Test that registerClass effects are visible from withing actions
	  contained in the same frame as the target clip is placed, even if
	  DoAction comes before DoInitAction, which itself can't see those
	  effects.

2007-09-25 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* gui/sdl.cpp, gui/sdlsup.h: add sdl_to_gnash_key() and sdl_to_gnash_modifier(),
	  cleanups.
	* server/button_character_instance.cpp: on_event() don't respond to keypress event
	  when keycode is 0(INVALID).
	  
2007-09-25 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/registerClassTest2.c: one more test.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/register_class_test3.sc, Makefile.am: one more testcase.
	  all passed.
	  
2007-09-25 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* gui/gui.cpp: change shortcut keys to lower case restore old
	  behaviour.

2007-09-25 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/VM.cpp,.h: Add ClassHierarchy object to VM. Doesn't yet
	  mark objects, though it will very soon.
	* server/asobj/ClassHierarchy.cpp,.h: Extend to use as a namespace
	  object for ActionScript independent of the "Global" object.
	* server/asobj/Global.cpp,.h: Accept a passed ClassHierarchy,
	  rather than stack constructing one.
	* server/parser/Makefile.am: Add asobj directory for use of
	  ClassHierarchy by abc_block.
	* server/parser/Namespace.h: Namespaces contain names, and this
	  enables that.
	* server/abc_block.h: Change Namespaces to be stored by pointer,
	  since the ClassHiearchy object does the creation now.
	* server/abc_block.cpp: More parsing. Validate super class
	  of all declared classes, declare stubs in the correct namespaces.
	
2007-09-24 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* server/gnash.h: correct some keycodes, extend support to
 	  extended ascii.
	* gui/gtk.cpp: clean up and extend keyboard mapping.

2007-09-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: clarify
	  test for bogus __proto__ delayed construction. We still need
	  to find a way to verify registerClass effects handling time.
	* server/asobj/xml.cpp: set _status to min 32bit signed int
	  if value is not a number, cast to_number() to an int otherwise.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/XML.as: two more successes.

2007-09-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test5.c:
	  replicate tests run from SWFACTION_INIT into SWFACTION_CONSTRUCT.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/XML.as: more test for .status.
	  See patch #6178 for the why.

2007-09-24 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test5.c: tests _proto__
	  property of parant/child/brother clips at onInitialize time.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: add few more 
	  tests for understanding the interesting __proto__ property.
	  
2007-09-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: moved ActionScript object
	  construction into its own method. A change introduced by
	  this commit is that onClipConstruct/onConstruct will be invoked
	  after tags of frame0. Our testsuite detected no changes (so we
	  need more). Youtube still works :)

2007-09-24 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/action_execution_order_test10.sc: found a way to
	  trigger user defined onConstruct with swfc.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/loop_test6.c: add test for onClipInitialize called
	  when jumping-back with onClipUnload defined.
	  
2007-09-24 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/loop_test6.c: Add test for onClipInitialize
	  also NOT called when jumping-back to after the character lifetime.

2007-09-24 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/namedStrings.h: More documentation,
	  remove duplicate enumeration
	* server/namedStrings.cpp: Don't duplicate string "Stage".

2007-09-24 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* configure.ac: Add requirement of boost serialization library
	* macros/boost.m4: Add requirement of boost serialization library

2007-09-23 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/namedStrings.cpp,.h: New files. Move pre-load string
	  enumeration from as_object and add new enumerations for the
	  known ActionScript classes.
	* server/asobj/ClassHierarchy.cpp,.h: New files. Delay loading
	  ActionScript classes until they are needed.  At the moment,
	  does not support loading them as extensions, though this is
	  planned.
	* server/Makefile.am: Add new files
	* server/Property.h: Define a new type DestructiveGetterSetterProperty
	  which servers as a place-holder to allow transparent loading
	  of resources when the value is fetched.
	* server/PropertyList.h,.cpp: New functions to allow use of the
	  (self)Destructive getters.
	* server/as_function.cpp as_object.cpp,.h as_value.cpp
	  edit_text_character.cpp movie_root.cpp sprite_instance.cpp
	  swf_function.cpp textformat.cpp: Change to new string enums.
	* server/asobj/AsBroadcaster.cpp ContextMenu.cpp NetStream.cpp
	  Stage.cpp xml.cpp: Change to new string enums.
	* server/asobj/Global.cpp: Use new ClassHierarchy object to
	  delay-load actionscript classes, except for Object, Function, Array.
	* server/asobj/Makefile.am: Add new files
	* server/parser/abc_block.cpp,.h: More work (still incomplete) on
	  parsing ActionScript 3.
	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp VM.cpp: Change to new string enums.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/KeyTest-Runner.cpp: Change to new string enums.
	* libbase/extension.cpp,.h: Add a function to load a library by
	  naming both the library and the function to be called.

2007-09-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/init_action_test.c:
	  Test that prototype of sprites have been set up to MovieClip one
	  at time of onClipInitialize call.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.swf:
	  Test that just-placed sprites (at time of init actions execution)
	  are instances of Object, not MovieClip !!

2007-09-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (stagePlacementCallback): notify
	  INITIALIZE event.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/registerClassTest2.c: 2 more successes.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: 44 more successes !!

2007-09-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/registerClassTest2.c,
	  testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc:
	  Expect the failures and the success introduced by reverting
	  the change which broke youtube.

2007-09-22 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/parser/abc_block.cpp: Change data() to &...front() since
	  data() is not standard.

2007-09-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/Dejagnu.sc: add 2 args to the totals()
	  call, one if which is expected of tests to be run, if it doesn't
	  match actual number of tests run will print and record a FAIL
	  message.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/check.sc: accept an arg in the totals()
	  macro to tell how many tests in total are expected to be run.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: expect
	  33 tests to be run.

2007-09-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: remove
	  redundant test.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (execute_frame_tags): revert the 
	  change in init action execution which blew up youtube.
	  We get more unexpected failures then unexpected succeses with
	  this, and I won't change them to *expected* for now.
	  I just felt this patch will limit annoyance to actual users while
	  we seek a better solution.

2007-09-22 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.cpp (processQueuedActions): fix a memory leak.
	  Thanks dli on #gnash for finding out.

2007-09-21 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_tri.{cpp,h}: Don't assume the
	elements in a std::vector are stored in contiguous memory.
	Whenver that must be true, copy the elements into a new
	block of memory. Store mesh_sets in the cache as non-
	pointer types, so we get automatic memory management. Use
	std::sort rather than qsort on the cache vector.

2007-09-21 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* libbase/tu_file.h: Add support for reading 64-bit doubles.

2007-09-21 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.h (testInvariant): fix a cast discarding const
	  qualifier.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (execute_frame_tags): optimized
	  execution loop and avoid calling both execute_state and 
	  execute_action (this is propedeutic for DoInitAction possibly
	  needing to execute in both cases).

2007-09-21 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.h, server/dlist.cpp,
	  server/button_character_instance.{cpp,h},
	  server/movie_instance.{cpp,h}, server/movie_root.cpp,
	  server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h},
	  server/video_stream_instance.{cpp,h}:
	  Rename character::construct to character::stagePlacementCallback
	  and update documentation to help clarity.

2007-09-21 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (goto_frame): make
	  sure m_current_frame always reflect the frame number
	  in which the control tags being executed were defined.

2007-09-21 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/action.cpp (call_method): add more info to the exception
	  derived from attempts to call a value which is neither a C nor an AS
	  function.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (goto_frame): wait for target frame
	  even if we won't push any action. Fixes bug #21126.

2007-09-21 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/parser/abc_block.cpp,.h: Read AS3 blocks. (unfinished)
	* server/parser/Namespace.h: AS3 namespaces (unfinished)

2007-09-20 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp (set_variable_name): create
	  the new variable if it doesn't exist in registering sprite.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/edittext_test1.sc: no more failures
	  here, but I'm sure it would be easy to break gnash more.
	  Zou, good luck :)

2007-09-20 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.{cpp,h}: add an updateText method
	  intended to be called by sprite_instance when a registered
	  text variable is updated; have set_text_value forward the 
	  text change back to the sprite_instance where any 
	  variable name is registered, for proper distribution of
	  the new text to any other TextField registered with the
	  same variable.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (set_text_value): use the new
	  updateText to update TextField text when variable name is
	  updated.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/edittext_test1.sc: more successes.

2007-09-20 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.{cpp,h}: define a private method
	  to parse the text variable into a sprite_instance and property name
	  components, to be used later to update the state of a registered
	  variable when text is updated otherwise and to unregister the
	  variable name when unloaded or when variable name changes.

2007-09-20 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* libbase/string_table.h: Doxygen documentation.

2007-09-20 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: goto_frame(), revert a few changes, 
	  which I believe caused the infinite loop when executing get_frame_number_test.swf
	
2007-09-20 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* server/asobj/Key.cpp: use key::codeMap instead of key::code.
		
2007-09-20 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/gnash.h: drop key::gnashKey, reorganize key::code.
	* server/event_id.h: make the constructor	to take an unsigned char type.
	* server/movie_root.cpp, server/button_character_instance.cpp,
	  server/asobj/Key.cpp: use key::codeMap instead of key::code, fix getAscii().
	* gui/gtk.cpp, gui/kde.cpp: update a few key names.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/key_event_testrunner.cpp: fix bogus tests about
	  Key.getAscii().	   
	
2007-09-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (goto_frame): fix blind jump to target
	  frame when > frame count. We still want to ensure_frame_loaded
	  instead. 
	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.{cpp,h}: mutex-protect access to named
	  frames map.

2007-09-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* extensions/mysql/mysql_db.cpp: use init_member, not set_member, when
	  initializing symbols (should fix use in SWF6 or lower versions -
	  untested but pretty sure).

2007-09-19 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* libbase/string_table.cpp,.h: Make member functions non-static and
	  add a facility to pre-load some strings.
	* server/PropertyList.cpp array.cpp as_environment.cpp as_function.cpp
	  as_object.cpp as_object.h as_value.cpp character.cpp
	  edit_text_character.cpp impl.cpp movie_root.cpp sprite_instance.cpp

	* server/vm/VM.cpp VM.h: Add pre-load of common property names, convert
	  string table usage, add string table member.
	* server/vm/action.cpp action.h: Remove enumeration of standard properties
	  with the special handler, use string table enumeration instead. Unifies
	  handling.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DefineEditTextVariableNameTest2.c: Success
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/KeyTest-Runner.cpp Makefile.am
	  attachMovieTestRunner.cpp intervalTestRunner.cpp
	  key_event_test2runner.cpp key_event_test3runner.cpp
	  key_event_test5runner.cpp key_event_testrunner.cpp: Convert string table
	  usage
	* testsuite/movies.all/Makefile.am gravity_embedded-TestRunner.cpp:
	  Convert string table usage
	* testsuite/server/GetterSetterTest.cpp PropertyListTest.cpp: Convert
	  string table usage

2007-09-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp (set_variable_name): reinitialize
	  text to default value.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/edittext_test1.sc: more successes.

2007-09-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/gtk.cpp (setInterval): add a note about the fact that the 
	  current way of setting up the FPS timer is bogus. Note that the
	  problem is related to A/V syncing...

2007-09-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.{cpp,h}: provide a generic
	  _name getter-setter.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: use character's version
	  for _name and _target getter/setter.
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: use character's
	  _name and _target getter/setter.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: successes
	  on _name and _target accesses, minor failures.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/edittext_test1.sc: successes
	  on _name and _target access.

2007-09-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: add tests
	  for effects of changing _name.

2007-09-19 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/gnash.h: more enums for extended ascii characters.

2007-09-19 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/edittext_test1.sc, Makefile.am: new testcase for 
	  TextField using swfc. Clearer then Ming based tests. TextField variable
	  still need some work.

2007-09-19 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/kde_glue_agg.cpp: fix initialization order warning.
	* gui/gui.{cpp,h}: draft an attempt at skipping rendering
	  when late of fps timer. It's experimental, and disabled
	  by default. Define SKIP_RENDERING_IF_LATE in gui.h to
	  try it out.

2007-09-19 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* configure.ac: Fixed typo.

2007-09-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: allow multiple edit_text_character
	  to be registered with a single variable name.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/DefineEditTextVariableNameTest2.c:
	  success in most tests (one still fails).

2007-09-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.cpp (unload): don't unload again already-unloaded
	  characters. Fixes the assertion failure in
	  action_execution_order_test12.sc.

2007-09-18 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/action_execution_order_test12.sc, Makefile.am:
	  add new testcase, caught an assertion here. Disable it if it blocks your
	  work.
	
2007-09-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (execute_frame_tags): execute
	  init actions *after* DLIST tags. 
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc:
	  No more failures in this case.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/init_action_test.c: a single
	  failure was introduced by this comit, for known reason.
	  We decided to accept the failure and take care of it later.

2007-09-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/array.{cpp,h}: Implement enumerateNonProperties().
	  Still not 100% correct but fixes youtube controls positioning
	  (bug #20469).
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: tests for enumeration
	  of array properties.

2007-09-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc:
	  Add visual traces of actions while being executed; add
	  comment about other finding.

2007-09-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/DoActionTag.h (doInitActionLoader): pass 'cid' value
	  to add_init_action().
	* server/parser/movie_definition.h (add_init_action): add support for
	  a 'cir' parameter, to ignore duplicated init actions for the same
	  character id.
	* server/parser/sprite_definition.h: update add_init_action signature
	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.{cpp,h}: update add_init_action
	  signature, use a std::set to keep note of character id for which
	  init actions have been added already, discarding the rest.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: more
	  successes.

2007-09-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc:
	  Add test to verify init actions have been executed
	  in the correct order.

2007-09-17 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.{cpp,h} (format_text): get text alignment
	  using a new private function, which checks for _autoSize settings too.
	  Fixes bug #20760.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (define_bits_jpeg3_loader): fix compiler
	  warning (signed vs. unsigned comparison).

2007-09-17 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libbase/string_table.h: Fixed compilation for non-32 bit platforms.
	* server/parser/video_stream_def.{cpp,h}: Use CapitalCase for types.

2007-09-17 Lauri Mylläri <rez>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: Also parse DelaySeek field for MP3 
	  in DEFINESOUND, fixes bug #21094.

2007-09-17 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/movie_definition.h: changed signature of get_playlist:
	  rename to getPlaylist, return by pointer, have the default
	  implementation return 0.
	* server/parser/BitmapMovieDefinition.{cpp,h}: don't build a dummy
	  PlayList just for implementing the get_playlist abstract method, 
	  it's not needed anymore (the default implementation does fine).
	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.{cpp,h}: use a std::map instead of a
	  std::vector to contain PlayList of each frame. This reduced memory
	  use for movies that don't have actions in *each* frame and removes
	  race conditions due to unexpected growth of frames while parsing
	  (when number of frames advertised in header doesn't match number
	  of SHOWFRAME found in the stream); (add_frame_name): don't insist
	  in _frames_loaded being less then advertised frame count.
	* server/parser/sprite_definition.{cpp,h}: use a std::map instead
	  of a std::vector for PlayList of frames. Cleanup construction
	  of dynamic sprite definitions now that we don't need to create
	  a fake PlayList only to store a dummy execute tag.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: update calls to getPlaylist.

2007-09-17 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/gnash.h: another code map for proper key handling.
	
2007-09-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Number.as: more tests for Number()
	  returning a primitive number rather then an object. I suspect
	  most builtin functions will need to support both invocation as
	  constructor *and* simple invocation.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/ops.as: more tests for comparison between
	  "different" nan values... :/

2007-09-16 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* plugin/klash/klash_part.{cpp,h}: Properly add URL arguments to
	the Klash commandline. This enables Youtube playback in Konqueror.

2007-09-16 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* libbase/string_table.cpp,.h: A string table to cut down on memory
	  usage and lookup time for properties, particularly in inheritance.
	  Preparation for AS3.
	* libbase/Makefile.am: Add string_table to list of files which the
	  Makefile knows about.
	* server directory:
	*  PropertyList.cpp,.h array.cpp,.h as_environment.cpp as_function.cpp
	   as_object.cpp,.h as_value.cpp character.cpp edit_text_character.cpp,.h
	   movie_root.cpp sprite_instance.cpp,.h swf_function.cpp textformat.cpp
	   timers.cpp: Update to use string table.
	* server/asobj directory:
	   AsBroadcaster.cpp ContextMenu.cpp LoadVars.cpp MovieClipLoader.cpp
	   NetStream.cpp Object.cpp Stage.cpp prophelper.h xml.cpp xml.h
	   xmlsocket.cpp: Update to use string table.

	* server/vm directory:
	   ASHandlers.cpp ActionExec.cpp action.cpp action.h: Update to use string
	   table.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all directory:
	   KeyTest-Runner.cpp attachMovieTestRunner.cpp intervalTestRunner.cpp
	   key_event_test2runner.cpp key_event_test3runner.cpp
	   key_event_test5runner.cpp key_event_testrunner.cpp: Update to use
	   string table
	* testsuite/movies.all/gravity_embedded-TestRunner.cpp: Update to use
	  string table
	* testsuite/server/GetterSetterTest.cpp PropertyListTest.cpp: Update to
	  use string table
	* server/swf.h: More notes about AS3 operations.

2007-09-16 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/gnash.h: add gnashCharacter code for proper key handling.
	
2007-09-15  Rob Savoye  <rob@ripple.welcomehome.org>

	* libbase/test.as: Only execute tests if the Lirc extension is
	installed. Check return codes for a clean exit.
	* libbase/lirc.cpp: Reduce debugging verbosity. Return a pointer
	with real memory behind it instead of by acident.
	* libbase/lirc.h: Add a field to contain the button name.
	* libbase/network.cpp: Don't just see if fd is set, make sure it's
	greater than zero to avoid problems!

2007-09-14  Rob Savoye  <rob@ripple.welcomehome.org>

	* extensions/lirc/test.as: Test case for Lirc extension.
	* extensions/lirc/Makefile.am: Chnage from lirc.* to lirc_ext.* to
	avoid name collisions. 
	* libbase/lirc.h, lirc.cpp: New files for lirc interface for
	remote control.
	* extensions/lirc_ext.h, lirc_ext.cpp: Renamed from lirc.*.
	* libbase/extensions.cpp: Change how extraneous directories get
	ignored.

	libraries. 
	* extensions/Makefile.am: Add Lirc extension.
	* extensions/dejagnu/dejagnu.cpp: Change debug support to log_*().
	* gui/Makefile.am: Add LIRC flags to build.
	* libbase/Makefile.am: Add lirc.cpp and lirc.h, new files for lirc
	support.
	* libbase/network.cpp, network.h: Add connectSocket() for talking
	to named pipes. 

2007-09-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	  computation of path bounds to the new path method.

2007-09-14 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.{cpp,h}: use USE_FREETYPE instead
	  of HAVE_FREETYPE2 ..
	* macros/freetype.m4: don't miss to add a -I to cflags; add a note
	  about the non-sense of the way we check for /usr/include.

2007-09-14 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* configure.ac: Look for broken -fvisibility-inlines-hidden.
	* macros/mtasc.m4: Added fallback path to /usr/share/ocaml/mtasc/std.

2007-09-14 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* server/asobj/BevelFilter_as.cpp, server/asobj/BitMapFilter_as.cpp,
	server/asobj/BlurFilter_as.cpp, server/asobj/ColorMatrixFilter_as.cpp,
	server/asobj/ConvolutionFilter_as.cpp,

	server/asobj/GradientGlowFilter_as.cpp,
	server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp, libbase/tree.hh

	Fixes for compilation with --enable-strict.

2007-09-13 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* server/parser/video_stream_def.{h,cpp}: Tie embedded video
	  frames to the swf-frame it is embedded in. The containers the
	  video frame is stored in was merged into one.

2007-09-13  Rob Savoye  <rob@ripple.welcomehome.org>

	* libbase/extension.cpp: Change alorithm for which files to ignore
	when scanning.

	* macros/lirc.m4: Search for lirc files, so we can support a
	remote control.

2007-09-13 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* configure.ac, testsuite/misc-ming.all/Makefile.am: add conditional
	  for Ming version at least 0.4 before building get_frame test.
	* libbase/rc.cpp: set writelog off by default (bug #21037).


2007-09-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (restart): don't call construct again, to
	  avoid re-registering with the global instance list.
	* server/movie_root.h (addLiveChar): assert the character being
	  registered is not already in the list
	* server/button_character_instance.{cpp,h}: remove dead code
	  (restart_characters); (construct): don't call restart right
	  after construct.

2007-09-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.cpp: cleanup debugging of ever growing list

2007-09-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/button_character_instance.{cpp,h}: implement unload() in an
	  attempt to properly mark as unloaded any character registered in the
	  global instance list (could happen for child sprites).
	* server/movie_root.cpp (markReachableResources): mark all characters
	  in the _liveChars. This makes Gnash more robust, but hides a problem
	  with the global instance list always growing. A proper fix would be
	  making sure that for *all* characters removed from a displaylist the
	  character::unload() is called, which marks the character as unloaded
	  and thus removes it from the global instance list. The change above
	  to button_character_instance seems not enough. I left debugging
	  output here so you can see how the list keeps growing.


2007-09-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h} (restart): properly cleanup
	  action queue and instances list, reset levels so that
	  only _level0 is kept. Still not 100% correct but fixes
	  bug #21068.

2007-09-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.{cpp,h}: drop the second list only used for
	  chils advancement (_timelineChars) and associated accessors
	  (visitAllByReversePlacement).
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: Add a global "advanceable" characters
	  list, used for advancement (in ::advance); provide an addLiveChar()
	  method to add characters that are willing to be advanced there.
	* server/button_character_instance.cpp (construct): register as
	  live character with the movie_root.
	* server/video_stream_instance.{cpp,h}: add a ::construct() method
	  to properly register as live character with the movie_root
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (advance_sprite): forget about advancing
	  childs, movie_root will take care of that; (construct): register
	  self as a live character with the movie_root.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test11.c: no more
	  expected failures here.

2007-09-13 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	  utilities/processor.cpp:
	  Revert Markus changes, as they introduce too many obvious failures.
	  Please avoid commits triggering failures on 'make check' and do
	  your best to have 'make check' run as many tests as possible.

2007-09-13 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* gui/NullGui.cpp libbase/Makefile.am libbase/triangulate_impl.h

	* Removed Files:
        libbase/tu_timer.cpp libbase/tu_timer.h

	Overhauled tu_timer with the se of std::clock and boost/timer.hpp.
	Might, break things, but it better get fixed this way.

2007-09-12 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

2007-09-12 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: Make sure we don't try to use
	a line width of 0: normalize the width.

2007-09-12 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_environment.cpp (parse_path): revert zou change as it
	  breaks callFunction_testrunner (assertion failure).

2007-09-12 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* server/event_id.h, server/asobj/Key.{cpp,h}
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp

	  redundant) for constructor and __constructor__

2007-09-12 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: Add a debugging function
	called check_error(), enabled by toggling the DEBUG_OPENGL

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/registerClassTest2.c: no more failures here.

2007-09-12 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/as_value.cpp: Make sure that exceptions don't
	  cause asserts, even if they escape into the wild.
	  (This escape is an error, but perhaps it should not
	  be fatal.)

2007-09-12 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp: cleanup variables initialization
	  order.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: minor tests for
	  removeMovieClip

2007-09-12 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp: drop parse_path for ActionCallFunction, it's

	* server/as_object.{cpp,h} (copyProperties): don't copy __proto__.

2007-09-11 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/AsBroadcaster.as: a couple more tests
	  for return from broadcastMessage.
	* server/asobj/AsBroadcaster.cpp: fix return from broadcastMessage.
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: asbroadcaster-broadcastMessage-retval-*.swf 
	  all pass now.
	* server/as_value.cpp (to_debug_string): fix debug print for movieclip
	  values.

2007-09-11 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/array.{cpp,h}: add removeFirst and visitAll methods.
	* server/as_object.{cpp,h}: add getMember and callMethod memebers
	  for ActionScript-like coding.
	* server/asobj/: Makefile.am, Global.cpp, AsBroadcaster.{cpp,h}:
	  First draft at AsBroadcaster. NOTE: this is not 100% compatible
	  but contains some special code to handle corner cases for compatbility
	  sake (mostly to avoid breaking swfdec testcases). The normal case
	  will still be faster then the average one.

2007-09-11 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* server/gnash.h: add more keycodes.
	* gui/gtk.cpp: pass more keystrokes.

2007-09-11 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: Disable polygon smoothing for now as
	it has some unwanted side effects.

2007-09-11 Bastiaan Jacques <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: GL_MODELVIEW is the default matrix
	mode, so don't bother setting it at every opportunity. Rather, reset it
	to the standard value after it is changed to something else. Round
	lines by drawing a round point on the end of every line (fixes
	#18014). Enable pologon smoothing (anti-aliasing).

2007-09-11 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/asobj/Global.cpp: don't initialize Function class for SWF < 6.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Inheritance.as, 
	  testsuite/actionscript.all/Function.as: disable a few confusing
	  and duplicated(but correct) tests for SWF5. more passes.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Number.as, 
	  testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: more passes.
	  
2007-09-10  Rob Savoye  <rob@ripple.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/curl.m4: sed any "-L/usr/lib" off the output of
	curl-config. This breaks some 64 bit systems.
	* macros/kde.m4: Do an ls instead of a test to find kde libraries.
	* macros/pango.m4, gtk2.m4, gnashpkgtool.m4, ffmpeg.m4: Use
	--libs-only-l with pkg-config as sometimes the path is wrong for
	64bit systems.

2007-09-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/morph2_character_def.cpp (read):
	  Set shapes bounds *after* calling ::read() on them.
	  Fixes bug #21020.

2007-09-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/bitmap_info.h: drop OGL-specific members.
	* libbase/image.{cpp,h}: cleanup the image_base interface:
	  - make more members private to reduce chaces of buffer size
	    and associated size-describing members mismatch (still more
	    to do)
	  - add more methods from statics which do not have access
	    to now-private members 
	* backend/render_handler_ogl.cpp: add OGL-specific members
	  to bitmap_info_ogl, update uses of image_base.
	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp, libbase/embedVideoDecoderFfmpeg.cpp,
	  libbase/embedVideoDecoderGst.cpp, libbase/image_filters.cpp,
	  server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp, fill_style.cpp,
	  server/fontlib.{cpp,h}, server/parser/BitmapMovieDefinition.cpp,
	  server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp, server/asobj/NetStream.cpp,
	  server/asobj/NetStreamFfmpeg.cpp, backend/render_handler_cairo.cpp:
	  Update uses of image_base

2007-09-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/NetStreamGst.cpp (GstInstallPluginsResultCb): comment
	  out unused parameter and garbage message.
	* server/parser/video_stream_def.cpp (dtor): delete [] since we
	  allocated with new [].
	* libbase/Makefile.am: drop image_filters.cpp (seems unused)
	* server/dlist.cpp (reset): remove unused variable.
	
2007-09-10 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/Makefile.am: enable tow old testcases.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: one more
	  test about init actions.
	  
2007-09-10 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/fill_style.cpp: Correct handling of morph fills.
	* server/styles.cpp: Correct handling of morph colors.
	* server/parser/morph2_character_def.cpp: Remove @@hack
	  line, and fix underlying problem instead. Should fix
	  bug #19085. Morph and Morph2 shapes now work correctly.
	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp: Be sure to read
	  on alignment where needed.

2007-09-08 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/video_stream_def.h: document class members,
	  add some notes or todo items
	* server/parser/video_stream_def.cpp (read): add a TODO item
	  as I think we're misreading the VIDEOFRAME tag.

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/video_stream_instance.h: keep definition by 
	  intrusive_ptr (just for consistency with other
	  character instances)
	* server/parser/video_stream_def.cpp (get_frame_data):
	  always set output parameters to 0 if requested frame
	  number is not available.

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.{cpp,h}: change signature of .reset() to
	  take a sprite_instance for calling set_invalidated() when
	  needed.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (restoreDisplayList): update
	  call to DisplayList::reset() - this optimizes loop-backs
	  and fixes a failure introduced by previous commit
	  (it's nice to see that performance issues are also tested
	  by our testsuite - we'd just need some more)

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (restoreDisplayList): don't use
	  a copy of the display_list to optimize the call to set_invalidated.
	  Removing characters from the copy would shift unloaded characters
	  to a different depth, which in turn would fail an assertion
	  (which is *needed* or set_invalidated would not include invalidated
	  bounds of just-unloaded characters).
	  BTW, this suggests me we need a lot of tests for inv.bounds. as the
	  latest changes for depth swap on unload did likely break a few
	  cases.

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: disable the too many debugging
	  prints left over from the big action order commit.

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/anaylse-results.sh: add detailed report
	  of unexpected successes and failures.

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Makefile.am,
	  testsuite/misc-ming.all/Makefile.am,
	  testsuite/misc-mtasc.all/Makefile.am,
	  testsuite/misc-swfc.all/Makefile.am,
	  testsuite/misc-swfmill.all/Makefile.am,
	  testsuite/swfdec/Makefile.am:
	  Don't have 'make check' fail here, rely
	  on analyzer to tell if something went unexpected.
	  This is to help with intermittent failures forcing
	  running the expensinve check over and over again.

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/anaylse-results.sh: exit with a failure if any real
	  failure or unexpected success is found in the logs. Cleanup
	  presentation code and output (the latter to now which subdirs have
	  failures or unexpected successes).

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.cpp (output operator): don't compare iterators from
	  different sequences !
	* server/movie_instance.cpp (advance): don't invoke ONLOAD event
	  handler, the event will be queued by ::construct instead
	* server/movie_root.cpp (setRootMovie): process actions
	  queued by effect of root movie construction.
	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}:
	  - Drop do_action(), m_action_list and m_on_event_load_called members.
	  - Make ::construct virtual so it can be overridden by movie_instance.
	  - Have add_action_buffer queue globally or execute actions immediately depending
	    on a new (misnamed) _callingFrameActions flag (I want to cleanup this part next).
	    Basically, all actions are queued to the global list, with two
	    exceptions:  init actions and callFrame actions.
	  - Expose a new public queueAction(action_buf&) method, currenly
	    unused but possibly for use in a cleanup of the preceding queue-or-execute
	    actions handling.
	  - Move registration as core broadcaster listener code into its own
	    function (registerAsListener).
	  - Refactor restoreDisplayList() to also execute *action* tags of
	    target frame, so to get order right.
	  - Far cleaner advance_sprite() implementation.
	* testsuite/MovieTester.cpp (ctor): properly construct root movie,
	  and render after construction.
	* testsuite/swfdec/swfdec_gnash_tester: advance 10 times as intended
	  by swfdec testsuite, not 11 as we needed to do due to gnash bugs.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/: action_execution_order_extend_test.c,
	  action_execution_order_test2.c, action_execution_order_test4.c,
	  action_execution_order_test5.c, action_execution_order_test7.c,
	  action_execution_order_test9.c, action_execution_order_test10.sc:
	  SUCCESSES !
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test2.sc: SUCCESSES !
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: SUCCESSES !

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-mtasc.all/: level5.as, level99.as: check
	  that at time of first-frame actions execution for loaded movies,
	  _currentframe is set to 1.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (loadMovie): don't use
	  movie_root::setRootMovie for loading external movies,
	  as that method is meant for kick-start only.
	* server/vm/action.cpp: remove dead code.

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/action_execution_order_test10.sc:
	  check that _currentframe is 1 when actions in first frame of
	  _root are executed
	* server/movie_instance.{cpp,h}: add overridden ::construct
	  method, taking care of ensuring frame1 is completely loaded
	  and calling the superclass version of it. 
	* server/movie_root.cpp (setLevel): call ::construct on newly
	  added levels (including level0).

2007-09-07 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/VM.{cpp,h}: change the VM::init() functionality
	  to NOT instantiate the movie definition. This is propedeutic
	  for a cleanup in movie_instance construction, which will be
	  performed by movie_root::setLevel in next patch.
	* gui/Player.cpp, testsuite/MovieTester.cpp,
	  testsuite/server/DisplayListTest.cpp,
	  testsuite/server/GetterSetterTest.cpp,
	  testsuite/server/PropertyListTest.cpp,
	  utilities/processor.cpp:
	  Update VM & stage (movie_root) initialization calls
	  to take into account VM::init() semantic change.

2007-09-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test4.c: more
	  explicit test showing that defining onLoad for _root in first
	  frame works, while doesn't work for child sprites.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (add_display_object): only syntetize 
	  and instance name when actually placing a new character (simplifies
	  the code and fixes a case related to ratio compatibility).

2007-09-06 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* libbase/FLVParser.cpp: Made it more robust by accepting empty
	   tags, fixing bug #20889.
	* server/video_stream_instance.cpp: Check for data being NULL.
	* server/asobj/NetStreamFfmpeg.cpp: A few changes to make it
	  work better with only video or audio - not complete yet.

2007-09-06 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/: Dejagnu.sc, check.sc:
	  Also print expression being tested with {x}check_equals 
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test1.c: Add tests
	  showing that onClipLoad event can reference self and characters placed 
	  either before or after the character carrying that event.

2007-09-06 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test3.c: Reorganize and recomment
	  the source file, please make sure you know the tags order of produced swf file 
	  after your update.
	  
2007-09-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.cpp (removeUnloaded): also remove from _timelineChars.

2007-09-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test3.c: attempt
	  to test REMOVEOBJECT before DOACTION (failed though, as Ming seems
	  to keep placing REMOVEOBJECT tags adjacent instead).
	  This test is reported as an evidence of behaviour 2 in
	  ActionsExecutionOrder#Verified_behaviour wiki page, so we either
	  need another or that behaviour is not verified !!

2007-09-05 Ivor Blockley <meteoryte@yahoo.com.au>

	* server/vm/action.{cpp,h}: add htmlText property to 
	as_standard_member ENUM
	* server/edit_text_character.{cpp,h}: add html property and cleanup
	handling of htmlText (note: still just strips tags at the moment).
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: 5 new passes, 1 new failure

2007-09-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.{cpp,h}: also maintain a list of characters by
	  placement and provide a visitByPlacement for visiting them.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: (advance_sprite): visit DisplayList
	  in reverse-placement order when advancing old and newly added
	  characters.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/action_execution_order_test2.c: one success
	  in action execution order.

2007-09-05 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* backend/sound_handler_{sdl,gst}.cpp: Remove primitive
	  audio syncing code. Fixes bug #20866 and #20851, but reopens
	  #20681.

2007-09-05 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.{cpp,h}: add ::unload method for taking
	  care of unloads triggered by parent unload.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (unload): use DisplayList::unload
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test4.sc: fix
	  destruction of childs w/out onUnload event handler defined.

2007-09-05 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: more tests about 
	  initactions, gnash fails by not respecting the actions order.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test4.sc: more tests for 
	  catching unloaded character bug, got a xcheck.
	
2007-09-05 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	* server/asobj/MovieClipLoader.cpp: iterator -> const_iterator.
	* libbase/timer.cpp: Added commentary.

2007-09-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: always check if we've been unloaded
	  by effect of a call to on_event(). Fixes bug #20974.

2007-09-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/sprite_definition.cpp (read): simplify handling of
	  malformed sprite definition (last SHOWFRAME not followed by END).
	  Fixes high CPU use and inresponsiveness while playing
	  gnashcrash.swf.

2007-09-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.{cpp,h}: add hasEventHandler() and queueEvent()
	  methods. Implement ::unload by queuing the UNLOAD event (not its
	  handlers
	* server/vm/ExecutableCode.h: Add QueuedEvent "executable code", for
	  queuing events rather then handlers.

2007-09-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.h: make execute_action() public, for use
	  by DoActionTag (for init actions).
	* server/swf/DoActionTag.h: execute init actions by directly
	  execute them (opposed to use add_action_buffer which queues them)
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (execute_frame_tags): simplify execution
	  of init tag (simply execute them rather then have them queue and
	  then execute the queue).

2007-09-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* NEWS: updated by copying from 0.8.1
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: support case-insensitive
	  htmlText property (for SWF6).
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: fix expected results
	  (more successes, one failure which only worked by luck before).
	* testsuite/anaylse-results.sh: print also unexpected successes.

2007-09-04 Asger Ottar Alstrup <asger@area9.dk>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: add minimal support for htmlText.

2007-09-04 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/fill_style.cpp,.h: Let fill style know how to read
	  morph (2) type styles as well, to avoid duplicating lots
	  of code.
	* server/styles.cpp,.h: Fill line style know how to read
	  morph2 tags for the same reason.
	* server/impl.cpp: Change MORPHSHAPE2 loader to activate it.
	* server/parser/morph2_character_def.cpp: Parse MorphShape2
	  tags as well as MorphShape.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: Recognize MorphShape2 tags.

2007-09-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.{cpp,h}: add an _abortOnUnload flag
	  for premature abortion of action buffers being executed,
	  always false for functions and true by default for
	  global code (overridable by a third optional constructor
	  argument). Check target for being unloaded (if _abortOnUnload)
	  at opcode-level.
	* server/vm/ExecutableCode.h (EventCode): set _abortOnUnload
	  to false when constructing ActionExec for event code.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/: movieclip_destruction_test1.sc,
	  movieclip_destruction_test3.sc: successes with premature
	  abortion of action buffers.

2007-09-04 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* configure.ac: make kde development package advice
	  accurate (see bug #20908).

2007-09-04 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.cpp (reset): don't ::unload() again
	  on already unloaded characters. They might still be
	  in the list (and not in the removed zone) due to their
	  having an onUnload handler to be invoked when their parent
	  was unloaded. Fixes last assertion failure in bug #20949
	  (copter.swf)

2007-09-04 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test{1,3,4}.sc: more tests.

2007-09-04 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test1.sc: fix some bogus tests
	  caused by bogus compiler convertion, and a few more tests, all passed.
	  
2007-09-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.cpp (unload): call queueEventHandler before setting
	  _unloaded to true.
	* server/dlist.cpp (wherever characters are unloaded): call unload() after
	  removing the character.

2007-09-04 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/font.cpp,.h: Add is_subpixel_font flag for DefineFont3 tag.
	* server/text.cpp: Size SWF8, SWF9 fonts correctly -- they use subpixel
	  shapes, so they need to be scaled when displayed.

2007-09-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (advance_sprite): don't use
	  DisplayList::advance against DisplayList copies, for which
	  invariant is not maintained.

2007-09-03 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* render_handler_agg_style.h: focal gradients now render correctly

2007-09-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (advance_sprite): don't call
	  removeUnloaded on DisplayList copies (their ::advance will skip
	  unloaded elements, anyway).
	* server/as_value.cpp (to_sprite): make the dangling reference a
	  debugging info, not an error.

2007-09-03 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/dlist.cpp: don't abort for unloaded characters in DisplayList::advance().
	  fixd a case in bug #20076.
	  
2007-09-03 Udo Giacomozzi <udo.gnu@nova-sys.net>

	* render_handler_agg_style.h: Some fixes for focal gradients

2007-09-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.cpp (unload): don't forget to call
	  the base class version of the method (properly setting _unload
	  flag).

2007-09-03 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* doc/C/usermanual/usage/gnashrc.xml: Warn in docs about including
	  protocols in black- and whitelists.

2007-09-03 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/character.h: Add depthInRemovedZone() methods.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test2.sc:
	  Additional tests, and a typo fix.

2007-09-03 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* backend/render_handler_agg_style.h Correct(maybe) the placement of the
	  focal point for focal gradient fills.
	* server/fill_style.cpp Read focal gradient fills in the right place
	  (after gradient records, not before), also added focal gradients to
	  known bitmap transforms.

2007-09-03 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se> 

	* macros/boost.m4: Commented out bogus check and improved the
	  checking of BOOST_CFLAGS.
	* libbase/tu_types.h: Use boost/cstdint.hpp instead of inttypes.h
	* server/vm/action.h: __SGI_LIBC_USING_FROM_STD(va_list)
	* gui/gnash.cpp: setlocale() IFF #ENABLE_NLS.

2007-09-03 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/fill_style.h,.cpp -- Add recording of focal point for focal
	  gradient fill.
	* backend/render_handler_agg.cpp, backend/render_handler_agg_style.h
	  Adding gradient focal fill. I'm not sure if I've done this correctly,
	  but it didn't break anything.

2007-09-02 Chad Musick <chadmusick@msbx.net>

	* server/fill_style.cpp -- Update the allow focal gradient fill style,
	  and to accomodate some format changes for SWF8+ tags.  Focal
	  gradients are not implemented yet -- I don't yet know how to do this.
	* server/impl.cpp -- Update DefineShape4 loader function from fixme_loader
	  to shape loader.
	* server/styles.h -- Change signature of read function to include the
	  movie definition since it may be part of a fill style, which needs this.
	* server/styles.cpp -- Change read function to read new line styles
	  allowed in newer SWF files.
	* server/parser/shape_character_def.cpp -- Change loader to know how
	  to read a DefineShape4 tag.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp -- Let the shape_loader be able to load
	  a DefineShape4 tag.

2007-09-02 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test2.sc: one more test.

	  about actions order. If any questions, please add to the wiki.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/Makefile.am: enable testcase.
	
2007-09-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.{h,cpp}: handle __proto__ has a normal property.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp (replace_display_object): log an error
	  if the character to be replaced is not found.
	* server/dlist.cpp (replace_character): don't restart the character
	  being added (fixes a problem with the ::restart function itself, in
	  that it also cleans up all properties, which now include the
	  __proto__ member).
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: more successes.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Object.as: more successes.

2007-09-01 Markus Gothe <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se> 

	* macros/boost.m4: push/pop CXXFLAGS/CPPFLAGS.
	* libbase/utility.h: Fixed a C++98/C99 incompt. error
	* libbase/utility.cpp: Use boost/cstdint.hpp instead of stdint.h.
	* libbase/zlib_adapter.cpp: Added 'using namespace gnash;'

2007-09-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/Object.cpp (attachObjectInterface): remove
	  useless call to set_member_flags (init_member does it).
	* server/as_object.{cpp,h}: removed dead code (clear)

2007-09-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf_function.cpp (ctor): make sure user-defined
	  function's initial prototype inherits from Object.
	* server/asobj/Object.cpp (getObjectInterface): really
	  end the inheritance chain (ie: don't override __proto__).
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Inheritance.as: a couple tests
	  added.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Object.as: more successes, and 
	  an additional (still failing due to non-proper __proto__ member)
	  test.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/toString_valueOf.as: one more success.

2007-09-01 Ivor Blockley <meteoryte@yahoo.com.au>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: success in invalid array.sort()
	  calls

2007-09-01 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/dlist.{cpp,h}: when unloaded character's unload() method
	  returns true (character or any of its childs has onUnload methods to
	  be run) don't really remove it from the list, but just shift it
	  down to the "removed" zone. Advance and display only non-removed
	  characters (depth-zone based for now, possibly too weak).
	  Add lots of paranoid invariant testing (not enough, missing the
	  one for no unloaded characters out of "removed" depth zone).
	* server/character.{cpp,h}: more info about removedDepthOffset,
	  assertion preveing double unload of a character (this can be 
	  probably easily broken by a focused testcase using removeMovieClip
	  on a removed but still-reachable character).
	* server/movie_root.{cpp,h}: added cleanupDisplayList() method, and
	  call it at the end of actions execution to properly cleanup removed
	  but still-reachable characters.
	* server/sprite_instance.{cpp,h}: implement a cleanupDisplayList, to
	  be called by movie_root, make sure to not include unloaded
	  characters when visiting the DisplayList for bounds extractions and
	  similar.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/MovieClip.as: soft-references successes
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/: loop_test7.c, loop_test8.c:
	  keep-alive-for-onUnload successes
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/unload_movieclip_test1.c: successes
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test2.sc: successes
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: remove-depths-*.swf successes

2007-08-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/asobj/gen-asclass.sh: add the getObjectInterface call.
	  (btw, gen-asclass.pl is being left behind).

2007-08-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/as_object.{cpp,h}: changed get_prototype to always return
	  the actual prototype (rather then returning the Object prototype
	  if unset).
	* server/: array.cpp, as_function.cpp, edit_text_character.cpp,
	  sprite_instance.cpp, video_stream_instance.cpp:
	  Initialize AS class interfaces (prototype) as being subclasses of

	  Video.prototype.__proto__
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: more tests for
	  Array.prototype.__proto__
	* testsuite/swfdec/PASSING: successes from latest swfdec
	  testsuite.

2007-08-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* testsuite/actionscript.all/Object.as: add test for
	  Object.prototype.__proto__ expected to be undefined (bad bug
	  in Gnash!).
	* server/array.cpp (array_length): handle attempts to set a negative
	  length as if length=0 was set, and log an AS error.
	  Still not correct, but saves a memory fill with swfdec testsuite.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/array.as: add test for setting a negative
	  length.

2007-08-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* macros/boost.m4: don't trash user-defined CXXFLAGS, and don't
	  provide one if not user-specified initially.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/check.sc: ops, last totals() define
	  was buggy, this one is good.

2007-08-31 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: removed more dead code.
	* server/dlist.cpp (swapDeptsh): don't swap to depths in the
	  deleted characters zone.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/movieclip_destruction_test2.sc:
	  less failures, few more tests.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/Dejagnu.sc: include file:line info
	  in xpass too...

	  to return a boolean value stating wheter any onUnload event was
	  queued due to removal.

	  pointer, w/out the font_id, provide setFont and getFont
	  methods, the former always performing a lookup.
	* server/parser/text_character_def.cpp (read): use
	  text_style::setFont() to set the font this properly updates
	  the actual font pointer in the text_format, fixing bug #20812.
	* server/edit_text_character.cpp: use text_style::setFont() to
	  set font by pointer.
	* server/parser/: movie_definition.h, movie_def_impl.{h,cpp},

2007-08-18 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* libbase/jpeg.cpp (jpeg_error_exit): only print SWF errors if
	  configured to do so; (input_impl): throw an exception if
	  jpeg_read_header detected errors.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (jpeg_tables_loader,
	  define_bits_jpeg_loader): early exception checking to avoid
	  parser interruption on malformed embedded jpeg.

2007-08-18 Felix Eckhofer <felix@tribut.de>

	* plugin/klash/klash_part.cpp: use the -u switch when invoking

	  SWF is < 7.

2007-08-17 Benjamin Wolsey <benjamin_pelican@yahoo.co.uk>

	* server/vm/VM.cpp (getPlayerVersion): define FLASH_VERSION as
	  a compatibility version for use by $version or

	  for use by javascript-based flash version detection kits.

2007-08-17 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

2007-08-16 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/edit_text_character.{cpp,h}: have a Range2d member to express
	  current TextField boundary (_width,_height). Implement _width and
	  _height setters. Add compile-time macro for debugging (still doesn't
	  work as expected).
	* server/gnash.h: add more descriptions, a set() method and TODO items
	  for the 'point' class.
	* testsuite/actionscript.all/TextField.as: more passes.

2007-08-16 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>

	* server/shape.cpp: remove useless include of hash_wrapper.h
	* gui/Makefile.am: fix build of sdl/cairo
	* configure.ac: abort if a requested renderer/gui combination

2007-08-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* gui/Makefile.am: typo preventing gtk/cairo combination from building
	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.{cpp,h}: add a destructor getting
	  rid of the resources associated with a face.
	* configure.ac: FLTK/OGL isn't supported, while SDL/OGL is !

	  Enable swfc testsuite if 'swfc' is found on the system.

2007-08-10 David Rorex  <drorex@gmail.com>

	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp: minor change to print the
	  freetype glyph format in human readable form. patch #6148.

2007-08-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.{cpp,h}: refactor the check for call stack
	  depth at end of execution to take depth at *start* of execution
	  into account.

2007-08-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/vm/ActionExec.cpp (cleanupAfterRun): don't assume the call
	  stack should be empty at the end of global code execution. Still
	  print an error as we need further investigation about it. Fixes
	  bug #20740.

2007-08-10 Paul Smedley <paul@smedley.info>

	* libbase/URL.cpp, libbase/container.h, libbase/network.cpp,
	  libbase/network.h, libbase/tu_config.h, libbase/tu_timer.cpp,
	  server/shm.cpp, server/shm.h, server/vm/ASHandlers.cpp,
	  utilities/dumpshm.cpp: Build support for OS/2.

2007-08-10 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/parser/Timeline.h (getFrameDepths): lock the mutex, as
	  documented in method description.

2007-08-10 Tomas Groth Christensen <tomasgroth@yahoo.dk>

	* backend/sound_handler.h, backend/sound_handler_{sdl,gst}.{h,cpp},
	  server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: Introduce the SoundInfo class which 
	  contains the properties of the sound (format, samplerate, etc.).
	  When parsing a sound-tag the SoundInfo-object is created and
	  passed to the soundhandler along with the audio data, and the
	  parser can later ask for the SoundInfo-object for a specific
	  sound, which is needed when parsing sound-streams.

2007-08-10 Alexander Sack <asac@jwsdot.com>

	* backend/Makefile.am, libamf/Makefile.am, libbase/Makefile.am,
	  libgeometry/Makefile.am, plugin/mozilla-sdk/Makefile.am,
	  server/Makefile.am: use $pkglibdir for unversioned libs.

2007-08-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (sound_stream_block_loader): don't
	  discard the first 4 bytes if not reading an MP3. Makes ADPCM
	  sound better for the feed.swf case (but ADPCM decoder needs
	  lot more work to be correct)

2007-08-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/FreetypeGlyphsProvider.cpp (getGlyph): don't abort if
	  FT_Load_Char doesn't return an outline glyph, rather print
	  an UNIMPLEMENTED message and the type of glyph you got.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (ADPCMDecoder::adpcm_expand):
	  Rather then throwing a ParseException, just print an error
	  as it's much likely the error is in Gnash parser, rather
	  then in a malformed SWF, and tests show we do a better
	  job like that then by stopping the parser.
	  Also, print an error if the bytesNeeded computation doesn't
	  match the actual number of bytes read.

2007-08-09 Sandro Santilli <strk@keybit.net>

	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp: move all ADPCM-related code in an
	  ADPCMDecoder class.
	* README_CVS: minimum version of automake is 1.9.6. 1.7 and 1.8 have
	  been tried w/out success. Might be a regression, but that is...
	* server/button_character_instance.cpp (construct): properly construct
	  all button child characters. Fixes bug #20729.
	* server/swf/tag_loaders.cpp (adpcm_expand): another try at fixing the
	  needed bytes count for compressed adpcm samples. Also, remove call
	  to ceil.

2007-08-09 Zou Lunkai <zoulunkai@gmail.com>
	
	* server/character.h: add a constant 'noRatioValue'.
	* server/dlist.cpp: In function move_display_object(), don't set ratio
	  to zero when no ratio value provided by the displaylist tags; In function
	  reset(), remove all none-referenceable characters.
	* server/parser/timeline.h: revert to 1.3, keep strk's design, use std::set
	  instead of std::map.
	* server/parser/movie_def_impl.h, movie_definition.h, sprite_definition.h:
	  update interface of getTimelineDepths().
	* server/parser/morph2_character_def.cpp: set ratio value to zero at rendering 
	  time when no one is provided. 
	* server/sprite_instance.h: add a member variable is_jumping_back.
	* server/sprite_instance.cpp: reimplement add_display_object(); cleanup 
	  goto_frame(); wipe out timeline design 1,2,3; deprecate resetDisplayList();
	  ready to deprcate 'replace_if_depth_is_occupied '.
	* server/swf/placeObject2Tag.cpp: set ratio to character::NoRatioValue instead of
	  zero when no ratio provided.
	* testsuite/misc-ming.all/place_and_remove_object_insane_test.c: xchecks to checks.
	  should fix bug 20504. All in all, hopefully improved the old timeline design.
	
2007-08-09 David Rorex  <drorex@gmail.com>

	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all: new directory for testcases.
	* testsuite/misc-swfc.all/check.sc, Dejagnu.sc, sound.sc, hello.sc,
	  sound.wav, Makefile.am: new test framework by using swfc.
