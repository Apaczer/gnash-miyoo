	* macros/libXML.m4: Don't look for XML libraries in the prefix
	directory.
	* macros/firefox.m4: Don't look for Firefox libraries in the
	prefix directory.

2005-12-26  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add doc subdirectory to DIST_SUBDIRS so it gets
	included in the tarball, but isn't part of the SUBDIRS, since we
	don't always want to build the docs.

	* macros/libXML.m4: Make the --with-libxml-include and
	--with-libxml-libraries add the library to the path. Test if
	pk-config exists. Use it if it does, but if it doesn't, do a brute
	force check of standard install locations for the XML2 headers and
	library.

	* backend/gnash.cpp: Define gofast and goslow here instead of
	xmlsocket.cpp.
	* server/xmlsocket.cpp: Reference gofast and goslow as externs so
	gnash actually builds with --disable-xml.

2005-12-25  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* plugin/plugin.cpp: Fix plugin name so it's recognized correctly
	to play flash movies looking for the proprietary Flash
	player. Instead of rendering the flash movie, copy the byte stream
	to /tmp instead so we can collect more test cases.

	* configure.ac: Fix the --disable-xml option so it actually
	works.

2005-12-21  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* macros/firefox.m4: Move enable test to here. If firefox-config
	doesn't exist, look for mozilla-config. If neither exists, the
	plugin won't be built as the mozilla development headers and
	libraries aren't installed.
	* Makefile.am: Don't try to build the plugin if the mozilla
	development SDK isn't installed.

	* config.h.in: Checkin header file produced by autoheader so Gnash
	builds on machines without the Autotools installed.
	* doc/C/images/car_crash.txt: Add file for alt text so conversion
	to info works correctly.

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Update legal notices.
	* doc/C/fdl-appendix.xml: Add FDL in DocBook format.

2005-12-20  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* libbase/Makefile.am, libgeometry/Makefile.am,
	server/Makefile.am: Don't install the headers.
	* plugin/mozilla-sdk/Makefile.am: Install the SDK library.

	* doc/C/gnash.xml: Add more content beyond just the command line
	arguments. Add a screenshot of the car crash test case.
	* configure.ac: Drop the plugin/test directory, it's unused for
	now.

2005-12-11  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* server/xml.cpp, xml.h: Update copyright notice.
	* server/xmlsocket.cpp, xmlsocket.h: Update copyright notice.

2005-12-10  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* AUTHORS, README, NEWS: Add content.
