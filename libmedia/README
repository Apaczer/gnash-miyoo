This directory contains both MediaHandler and SoundHandler
interfaces and implementations.

Interfaces are in this dir, implementations in subdirs.

Implementations for MediaHandler are gst and ffmpeg, in
their own directories.

The only current implementation of SoundHandler is sdl,
which currently resides under ffmpeg dir for historical
reasons.

The layout of this directory should change after 0.8.4
release is out, so to have two separate directories
for "MediaHandler" and "SoundHandler". See doc/DESIGN
in top-level source dir for a picture of it.
