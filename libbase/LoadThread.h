/// \brief
/// The LoadThread class can be used to download from a file
/// or stream using a thread, without having to block.
///
/// When the object is created it starts a thread which seeks forward
/// in the tu_file given as an argument to the constructor, which will
/// make cause the tu_file backend to download the amount of data needed
/// to complete the seek. This is repeated until the complete file is
/// downloaded. It is possible
/// for the object owner to query for data, position, loaded data,
/// total data while downloading, without blocking. Though if there has 
/// not been downloaded enough data to accomendate a request (seek/read)
/// it will block until the data is present (curl_adaptor behavoir).
///
/// When using the LoadThread, all access to the tu_file should be
/// done through LoadThread, or it will likely break.
///
/// @todo When we read from a real movie stream (rtmp) we might
/// want to use a cirkular-buffer.
